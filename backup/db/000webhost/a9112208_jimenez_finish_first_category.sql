Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2856" style="margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0" alt="about-modern-wordpress" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2984" alt="responsive" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255" data-recalc-dims="1" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2954" alt="colors" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2967" alt="themes" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344" data-recalc-dims="1" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg. This is our second release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. We think it’s been going great.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">on the make/core blog</a>.

BuddyPress core developer Boone Gorges announced the beta and summarized new features and changes that will be important for you to test.</p>\n<p>This release will introduce a handful of new admin tools for managing BP communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-profile-editing-in-the-wordpress-admin" target="_blank">User profile data can be edited in the admin</a>: Dashboard > Users</li>\n<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-better-spam-management-capabilities-for-administrators" target="_blank">Non-multisite installations can ham/spam users</a>: Dashboard > Users</li>\n<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-signups-administration-screen" target="_blank">New admin screen for managing signups</a>: Dashboard > Users > Pending</li>\n<li>BuddyPress tools menu has new tools for correcting data that occasionally gets out of sync: Dashboard > Tools > BuddyPress</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One front-end feature that should be tested is the synchronization of blog-related activity comments with blog comments. If a user replies to a new blog post activity item, that activity reply will also post back to the blog as a comment. This helps to keep the conversation synchronized in both places.</p>\n<p>Those are the most visible items to test. However, a large portion of the updates in this release are non-visible improvements under the hood. This includes performance improvements for object caching and pre-caching of activity-related data, a new API for registering xprofile field types, and rewritten metadata functions that now use WordPress&#8217; core metadata API.

(For a complete list, see <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=2.0">this report</a>). First, user-facing stuff:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a number of new administrative tools:\n<ul>\n<li>User Extended Profile data is now editable at Dashboard &gt; [Network Admin &gt;] Users</li>\n<li>Non-Multisite installations can now perform spam actions from Dashboard &gt; Users</li>\n<li>Dashboard &gt; Tools &gt; BuddyPress contains a number of tools for correcting data that occasionally gets out of sync on BP installs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In addition, signups/registrations have been completely overhauled. There is now a subsection on Dashboard &gt; [Network Admin &gt;] Users for handling Pending users, where you can resend activation emails, perform manual activations, and more. The way BP integrates with WP&#8217;s signup system under the hood has also been rewritten; on non-Multisite, we now mimic WPMS&#8217;s wp_signups functionality. We thinkhttps://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4551 this is a much more flexible, consistent system for all users of BuddyPress. These new workflows need the particular attention of people who are currently administrators on BP sites with open registration &#8211; you will best understand the pain points that these changes are meant to address.</li>\n<li>Blog-related activity comments now sync back to the source blog. That is, a reply in the activity stream to a &#8220;Boone posted a new blog post&#8221; item will create a corresponding comment on the blog post itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been extensive changes under the hood, including large performance increases and new developer tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activity actions &#8211; strings in the activity stream like &#8220;Boone and Ray are now friends&#8221; &#8211; are no longer (only) stored statically in the database, but are generated dynamically at runtime. This should alleviate several longtime headaches related to data staleness and multilingual sites. But it has also resulted in a number of changes related to the pre-caching of activity-related data. Watch http://bpdevel.wordpress.com in the upcoming days for a discussion of what plugin developers will need to know about the new system (short version &#8211; plugins that insert activity items will continue to work as before, but should be good citizens and update to the new technique). See <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3856">#3856</a> for background.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a brand new API for registering xprofile field types, and our own field types have been completely rewritten to use it. See <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5220">#5220</a>.</li>\n<li>User <code>last_activity</code> data has been moved from the usermeta table to the activity table. This ought to result in very sizable performance improvements for larger sites. Plugin developers should verify that their plugins are working correctly with these changes. See <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/user-last_activity-data-and-buddypress-2-0/">this post on bpdevel</a> for more background and specifics.</li>\n<li>Major improvements have taken place with respect to object caching throughout BuddyPress. If you use Memcached, APC, or some other persistent object caching backend on your BuddyPress site, please consider testing this beta.</li>\n<li>Metadata functions have been completely rewritten to leverage WP&#8217;s core metadata API. See <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4551">#4551</a> and especially <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5399">#5399</a> for what plugin devs will need to know about backward compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you&#8217;ve found a bug</strong>, please report it to <a href="http://buddypress.org/support">the support forums</a> or <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org">our development tracker</a>.

However, I&#8217;ve discovered a few other ways to monitor upcoming WordCamps.</p>\n<div id="attachment_19870" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WordCampScheduleFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[18997]"><img class="size-full wp-image-19870" alt="WordCamp Schedule Featured Image" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WordCampScheduleFeaturedImage.png" width="639" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/keso/2262459574/">keso</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>In late 2013, <a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamps/feed/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamps/feed/">WordCamp central added RSS feeds</a> that notify subscribers when an event is added to the schedule.

ICS is a file extension used to display calendar data and is supported by iCalendar and Google Calendar.</p>\n<div id="attachment_19967" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordcampcalendar.png" rel="prettyphoto[18997]"><img class="size-large wp-image-19967" alt="Upcoming WordCamps In iCalendar" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordcampcalendar-500x383.png" width="500" height="383" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Upcoming WordCamps In iCalendar</p></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, we discovered a <a title="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/calendar/report-an-issue/importing-and-exporting/google-chrome/UQ6P1Im8eY8" href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/calendar/report-an-issue/importing-and-exporting/google-chrome/UQ6P1Im8eY8">bug with Google Calendar</a> that doesn&#8217;t allow importing from a URL or from the actual ICS file.

Importing the ICS file into iCalendar presented no issues.</p>\n<h3>Paving The Way To Integrate Data Into Mobile Apps</h3>\n<p>There is <a title="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/338" href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/338">work underway</a> to make the scheduling data more accessible. One idea is to move the ICS file into a plugin and then place the data into a JSON endpoint. However, the <a title="http://wptavern.com/ryan-mccue-on-creating-the-json-rest-api-for-wordpress" href="http://wptavern.com/ryan-mccue-on-creating-the-json-rest-api-for-wordpress">JSON API</a> has yet to be added to core. I asked Ian Dunn, one of many volunteers working on improving the WordCamp central website, what opportunities become available by using JSON. He said, &#8220;By using the JSON API, we&#8217;ll be able to integrate the data into mobile apps.&#8221; With the possibility of an official <a title="http://wptavern.com/what-would-you-like-a-wordcamp-mobile-app-to-do" href="http://wptavern.com/what-would-you-like-a-wordcamp-mobile-app-to-do">WordCamp mobile app</a> being developed, having access to a schedule of upcoming WordCamps seems like a natural fit.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 00:29:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: iThemes Working Fast To Fix Users Upgrade Woes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=19974";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:156:"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-working-fast-to-fix-users-upgrade-woes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ithemes-working-fast-to-fix-users-upgrade-woes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4498:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BetterWPSecurityFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[19974]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19190" alt="Better WP Security Featured Image" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BetterWPSecurityFeaturedImage-500x159.png" width="500" height="159" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week, <a title="http://wptavern.com/better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities" href="http://wptavern.com/better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities">we reported</a> the Better WordPress Security plugin would be renamed to <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">iThemes Security</a>. We also shared important details to prepare users for the upgrade. Because of the name change, users needed to re-enable the plugin or risk seeing errors. Despite the beta testing period, the upgrade process hasn&#8217;t gone smoothly for some users. Some have chosen to vent their frustrations by writing <a title="http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/better-wp-security?filter=1" href="http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/better-wp-security?filter=1">one star negative reviews</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like writing bad reviews. Three days ago I would give this plugin five stars without hesitation. Unfortunately, upgrading to 4.02 and then 4.05 broke the checkout functionality on my web store which resulted in lost sales and no clear solution in sight. Definitely a rushed update with insufficient testing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Considering the plugin has over 1.8 million downloads, it&#8217;s inevitable some users would run into problems. As is the nature of software development, internal testing can only get you so far. According to Chris Wiegman, primary developer for iThemes Security, the plugin underwent the largest amount of beta testing by iThemes.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>This weekend’s agenda: bugfixes. Even with the largest beta weve ever done its amazing what isnt caught. fortunately there arent many to fix</p>\n<p>&mdash; Chris Wiegman (@ChrisWiegman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisWiegman/statuses/449629198244528128">March 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t upgraded yet, I encourage you to <a title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/common-issues-related-to-40-update-read-first?replies=1" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/common-issues-related-to-40-update-read-first?replies=1">read this guide</a> which lists the most common issues related to the 4.0 update.</p>\n<h3>Beta Testing Only Gets You So Far</h3>\n<p>While some of the blame can be placed on iThemes Security for not picking up on specific bugs, it&#8217;s impossible to test in every conceivable environment or combination thereof. Take WordPress for example. Despite thousands of people participating in the WordPress beta period, a lot of bugs and problems are reported after the stable version is released. It makes sense because the amount of users and environments using the stable version are far greater than the number participating in the beta period.</p>\n<h3>iThemes Is Working As Fast As They Can To Fix Bugs</h3>\n<p>I got in touch with Cory Miller, CEO of iThemes, and asked him what the team is doing to address issues users are having with iThemes Security. Considering the number of users and types of changes made to the plugin, the team thinks overall, the upgrade has gone well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our motto has always been to ship good, tested work and iterate on it fast. As we get more data on bugs and issues, we&#8217;re seeking to figure them out and handle them accordingly. This is a commitment we&#8217;ve held since 2008 and will into the future.</p>\n<p>Prior to launch, we had the biggest beta program for this release we&#8217;ve ever had and tested as thoroughly as we could (internally and with our beta group). We did our best, testing this before release, but any good software developer will tell you, especially with the variety of hosting and WordPress setups that you&#8217;re bound to miss something.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you encounter a bug, please <a title="http://ithemes.com/security/bugs/" href="http://ithemes.com/security/bugs/">report it to iThemes</a>.

The app broke onto the scene last year, positioned as a game-changing challenger to the increasingly unpopular policies of Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>After supporting the native social networking aspect for several months, John Saddington, the app&#8217;s creator, found that most users were not looking to get signed up to yet another social network. The costs of supporting that aspect of the app were also skyrocketing. Saddington knew he needed to make some tough decisions.</p>\n<h3>Pressgram Moves to Focus on More Concentrated Publishing Capabilities</h3>\n<p>Version 2.0, <a href="http://blog.pressgr.am/v2-0-release/" target="_blank">released</a> last week, is a major update that completely <a href="http://blog.pressgr.am/native-social/" target="_blank">removes the social layer</a>, which Saddington had been working to pare from the app since the beginning of this year. He felt that it was time to bring Pressgram around to its original purpose. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">The heart of my intent was always about digital publishing</span>,&#8221;</strong> Saddington said. &#8220;This version is much more aligned with that original intent and vision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cutting a major feature from a popular app is bound to bring some disappointment to users, but it is part of the natural process of discovering which features can be best supported and maintained long term. No app is born perfect in its first iteration, and Saddington decided that keeping &#8220;publishing first&#8221; was the best way to strengthen the app from both a technical and cost perspective.</p>\n<p>Though Pressgram first began as a WordPress-powered app, it has evolved to become a more open system, designed to support all kinds of publishing platforms. &#8220;I figured that if we were going to start encouraging more people to tell their visual stories then it was worth spending the time inviting all types of visual storytellers to the table!&#8221; Saddington said. Pressgram 2.0 expands the app&#8217;s publishing capabilities to include more platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.org</li>\n<li>Blogger / Blogspot</li>\n<li>Squarespace</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Google+</li>\n<li>Typepad</li>\n<li>MovableType</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pressgram Licensing Will Remain Proprietary</h3>\n<p>Pressgram was fairly groundbreaking in the WordPress app space when it launched. However, many in the WordPress community were disgruntled that the app wasn&#8217;t open source, as it was based on OS software and could potentially serve to move the WP app space forward.</p>\n<p>The last time we spoke with Saddington, he was open to considering an open source license for the app down the road. At this point in time, however, it seems that Pressgram will continue under a proprietary license.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There will always be those that feel strongly about &#8220;open source ALL THE THINGS&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure I will ever satisfy those folks with any answer at this point in time &#8211; there are already some amazing OS alternatives to Pressgram that will suit their needs, for sure!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Saddington cut his teeth with proprietary software working with Macromedia Flash in the 90&#8242;s and has worked with a number of proprietary languages over the course of his career. He naturally floats back and forth between open and closed source software and appreciates the pros and cons of working with both. In the end, it comes to down to pure pragmatism for him in tackling his projects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That being said, people will always be people and I&#8217;ve come to realize that I&#8217;m much more interested in working with pragmatists first and politicians second; in other words, I really enjoy building great stuff that helps people and far less interested in spending time debating the merits of this development philosophy over that one. I&#8217;m not a political person to being with so that always helps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Saddington will continue to polish Pressgram&#8217;s publishing features and focus on making the app better in the long term. At this time, he doesn&#8217;t have plans to expand the app&#8217;s audience to Android, although he&#8217;s open to the idea. &#8220;I simply don&#8217;t have time at this very moment to give it much thought or development time (or project manage a team that could help),&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether or not someone would have already built an Android app if the original app were open source. Ultimately, licensing is a personal decision for an engineer, which comes down to philosophy, workflow and communities. Saddington said that it has been refreshing and healthy for him to engage in other online cultures and connect with other developer communities.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/desk-pm-icon-brand.png" rel="prettyphoto[19852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/desk-pm-icon-brand.png" alt="desk-pm-icon-brand" width="256" height="256" class="alignright size-full wp-image-19980" /></a>He&#8217;s currently working on a new desktop publishing client called <a href="http://desk.pm" target="_blank">Desk PM</a>, which will support Markdown.

Saddington will continue to support Pressgram and will draw on that experience to roll out a new desktop app for publishing to multiple platforms.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 22:01:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"WordPress.tv: Kathryn Presner: Help Me Help You: The Art And Science Of Getting Good WordPress Support";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33392";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/28/kathryn-presner-help-me-help-you-the-art-and-science-of-getting-good-wordpress-support/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:752:"<div id="v-78NB6yjI-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33392/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33392/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33392&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/28/kathryn-presner-help-me-help-you-the-art-and-science-of-getting-good-wordpress-support/"><img alt="Kathryn Presner: Help Me Help You: The Art And Science Of Getting Good WordPress Support" src="http://videos.videopress.com/78NB6yjI/video-f7a258dd35_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 18:44:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WordPress.tv: Stacey Harris: Hit Publish, Now What?

We’ll talk about what they do, how they work, and about websites that build their businesses around stolen WordPress themes and plugins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article contains a lot of great information but it classifies commercial plugins being available for free as <em>stolen plugins</em>. If a commercial plugin is licensed under the GPL, the code can&#8217;t be stolen. There are always people looking to get something for nothing which is why malicious developers will always have some success using free versions of commercial plugins.</p>\n<p>While users are getting commercial plugins for free, they may also be getting backdoors and malicious software. This is not a new problem and it doesn&#8217;t affect just plugins. In 2009, Leland Fiegel published a screencast that shows how dangerous it is to use free themes discovered by Google.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>The <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin repository</a> is the most trustworthy place to download plugins. There are a team of volunteers that review plugins to make sure they abide by a <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">strict set of guidelines</a> before they&#8217;re added. The repository is constantly under the watchful eyes of the community and if anything malicious is added to a plugin after it&#8217;s been approved, it&#8217;s removed until it&#8217;s fixed.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpvsgithub.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19886]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15216" alt="WordPress Versus Github" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpvsgithub-500x185.jpg" width="500" height="185" /></a></p>\n<p>More and more plugin developers are moving their plugins over to <a title="https://github.com/" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. If you&#8217;re going to use a plugin from Github, research the author and make sure they&#8217;re legitimate. Check to see if the plugin is also available on the plugin repository since development can be synchronized between the two. The best advice is to purchase plugins from the original source. This way, you know what you&#8217;re getting and you&#8217;ll be able to receive support if you run into problems.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 21:10:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami to Host Free WordPress Beginners Workshop for Kids";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=19858";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:194:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-to-host-free-wordpress-beginners-workshop-for-kids?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-miami-to-host-free-wordpress-beginners-workshop-for-kids";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2084:"<div id="attachment_19878" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kids.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19858]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kids.jpg" alt="photo credit: Lupuca - cc" width="1024" height="478" class="size-full wp-image-19878" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lupuca/8720604364/">Lupuca</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p><a href="http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami</a> is nearly sold out with an estimated 700 WordPress fans to be in attendance.

We&#8217;ll walk them through the process of setting up and customizing a blog on WordPress.com. This will be a fun, interactive session where everyone will be encouraged to participate and ask questions.</p>\n<p>Although the session is geared toward kids aged 8-12, it will be open to any age. Children under 18 can attend for free with a parent who has a ticket to WordCamp Miami. The workshop will be held Sunday morning, May 11th, which also coincides with Mother&#8217;s Day.</p>\n<p>The last remaining tickets to WordCamp Miami are selling fast. If you have kids, your ticket includes this family-oriented WordPress beginner&#8217;s workshop. Get in touch with WordCamp Miami organizers via email (<a href="mailto:miami@wordcamp.org">miami@wordcamp.org</a>) if you&#8217;d like to attend.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have children in the 8-12 age range who use WordPress, we&#8217;d love to hear from you about topics that would be most beneficial.

know?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 19:33:22

For example, some subject matter may necessitate a reference to racist material or a fraudulent business.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to SEO, the age old maxim &#8220;Any press is good press&#8221; still proves to be true. By linking to a dubious website you are involuntarily strengthening the site&#8217;s position in search engines.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be complicit in promoting a site of ill-repute, there&#8217;s a service that you can use to deny these sites the SEO benefits of your link. <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/" target="_blank">Donotlink</a> is a site where you can paste in links to shady websites and receive a custom URL that will not not improve their search engine rankings.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/donotlink.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19728]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/donotlink.jpg" alt="donotlink" width="773" height="278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19812" /></a></p>\n<p>It works in a similar way to your standard url shorteners, except that it goes one step further to route questionable links through a unique intermediate URL which then forwards the visitor to the final destination via Javascript.</p>\n<p>Donotlink employs three additional methods to prevent search engines from crawling the questionable site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blocks the URL in its robots.txt file, so (search engine) robots are discouraged from crawling it</li>\n<li>Adds the &#8220;nofollow&#8221; attribute to the link</li>\n<li>If a known robot decides to crawl the link, Donotlink will identify it and serve it a blank page (403 Forbidden) instead of redirecting to the url.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who might use donotlink? The site offers a few secenarios wherein one might consider using the service:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Skeptics, bloggers, journalists and friends on social media use donotlink to link to scams, pseudoscience, misinformation, alternative medicine, conspiracy theories, racist / sexist blog posts, etc. without improving the search engine position of the site they are discussing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to use the service but don&#8217;t want to be bothered to visit the site each time, you can structure your URL like so:</p>\n<pre>http://www.donotlink.com/www.example.com/shady/stuff.html</pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re linking to questionable material quite often or simply want to take a principled stand against the spread of misinformation, <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/" target="_blank">Donotlink</a> is an easy way to prevent your site from sending &#8220;Google juice&#8221; to the bad guys. This seems like it would be an easy WordPress plugin to create and could be useful for publications that help bring attention to shady practices.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 18:44:35

we talk about the <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress">basics of WordPress security</a>, we always tell you to use a very strong password. The recently added <a title="http://wptavern.com/ridiculously-smart-password-meter-coming-to-wordpress-3-7" href="http://wptavern.com/ridiculously-smart-password-meter-coming-to-wordpress-3-7">password strength meter</a> helps to facilitate the process. But what about usernames? WordPress offers a way to change your display name which acts as a username alias. However, it doesn&#8217;t hide the username since it&#8217;s used within the URL and can&#8217;t be changed. For example, http://wptavern.com/author/username is always my account, despite what my display name is.</p>\n<div id="attachment_19732" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LeakyUsernamesFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[19489]"><img class="size-full wp-image-19732" alt="Leaky Usernames Featured Image" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LeakyUsernamesFeaturedImage.png" width="638" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/23390123/">Kris Krug</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Some argue the leaking of usernames is a security risk. Dion Hulse, a core contributor to WordPress, explained the reasoning behind leaked usernames in a <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20235#comment:7" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20235#comment:7">trac ticket</a> 19 months ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has been stated in previous tickets, &#8220;leaking&#8221; of the username is not deemed a security issue by WordPress.org, as it&#8217;s a conscious decision to use the username as the slug in the URL. If you don&#8217;t like this default behaviour, there are plugins in the repository which allow you to change the url format to your preferred layout.</p>\n<p>Instead of attempting to provide security by forcing people to guess your username, you should be focusing on improving passwords, and/or considering two-factor authentication (ie. Google Authenticator) if your passwords are known to be insecure and/or weak.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While not exactly the same scenario, <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3708" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3708">this trac ticket</a> from seven years ago indicates how long the consensus has been around. The username is treated as common knowledge since it&#8217;s not difficult to determine. When I asked Andrew Nacin, lead developer for WordPress 3.9, whether the information shared by Hulse is still accurate, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s fairly similar language we use when replying to security inquiries.&#8221; He then offered similar advice, &#8220;Create a strong password. Then, instead of playing games with your username, use a <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Two_Step_Authentication" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Two_Step_Authentication">two-factor authentication</a> plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What Is Two-Factor Authentication?</h3>\n<p>Logging in with a password is considered single-step authentication. It relies only on something you know. Two-step authentication, by definition, is a system where you use two of the three possible factors to prove your identity, instead of just one. In practice, however, current two-step implementations still rely on a password you know, but use your phone or another device to authenticate with something you have.</p>\n<h3>Two-Factor Authentication Using Jetpack Single Sign On and WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>Jetpack comes with a module called <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/sso/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/sso/">Single Sign On</a>. When activated, it allows visitors to use their WordPress.com login credentials to register accounts on self-hosted WordPress sites. This is important because users of WordPress.com have the ability to turn on two-factor authentication for their account.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TwoFactorEnabled.png" rel="prettyphoto[19489]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19623" alt="Two-Factor Authentication Enabled" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TwoFactorEnabled-500x214.png" width="500" height="214" /></a></p>\n<p>By enabling two-factor authentication on WordPress.com, the account will be protected when used to register with any WordPress site using the single sign on module, whether or not it&#8217;s using a two-factor authentication plugin.</p>\n<h4>Alternative Two-Factor Authentication Plugins</h4>\n<p>There are plenty of alternatives to using WordPress.com and the single sign on module. A search of the plugin repository for two-factor authentication plugins <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=two-factor+authentication" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=two-factor+authentication">shows 40 results</a>. I asked Brennen Byrne, co-founder of <a title="http://getclef.com/" href="http://getclef.com/">Clef,</a> what advice he has for those looking to add two-factor authentication to their site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When deciding on a two-factor authentication plugin, you should look for one that is well maintained and frequently updated. Two-factor requires that you trust the sender of your messages, so you shouldn&#8217;t use a plugin that&#8217;s out of date or someone&#8217;s side-project.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a title="http://vip.wordpress.com/security/" href="http://vip.wordpress.com/security/">WordPress.com VIP</a> specifies passwords as the weakest link in the security of anything you do online.

People rely on the smiley to add tone and feeling, which are often absent when communicating online. This is especially important in the case of text messaging and micro-blogging applications like Twitter where characters are limited. An emoticon can make all the difference between what might be perceived as a malicious jab vs. a good-natured joke.</p>\n<p>The controversy surrounding WordPress&#8217; built-in support for smilies has surfaced again in light of WordPress.com introducing a new set of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-gets-new-standard-and-secret-emoticons" target="_blank">modernized smilies</a>. If you&#8217;ve had smilies turned off in WordPress, and have always kept them turned off, then this discussion doesn&#8217;t affect you. But for the millions of WordPress sites where content creators have embraced smilies, the community is approaching another interesting fork in the road.</p>\n<h3>A Bit of Smiley History: WordPress Shows Its Teeth</h3>\n<p>In order to provide proper context for the current WordPress smilies debate, it&#8217;s important to explore a bit of smiley history. The mere mention of changing emoticons has always evoked a visceral reaction from the WordPress community.</p>\n<p><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145" target="_blank">Ticket #10145</a> is home to a five-year-old debate that was recently reignited following the suggestion that core might update to use the new WordPress.com smilies. The ticket proposed that WordPress core replace the old smilies by incorporating a plugin containing what contributor <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jdub" target="_blank">@jdub</a> believed to be <strong>&#8220;sexier (GPL and Public Domain) smilies from the GNOME and Tango icon themes.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<div id="attachment_19760" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tango-gnome-smilies.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19730]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tango-gnome-smilies.jpg" alt="Tango/GNOME Smilies" width="800" height="440" class="size-full wp-image-19760" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tango/GNOME Smilies</p></div>\n<p>Without any discussion, the new smilies were unilaterally imposed upon everyone, as outlined in Jeff Chandler&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://wptavern.com/nothing-to-smile-about" target="_blank">Nothing To Smile About</a>,&#8221; an account of how the new emoticons ended up in core.</p>\n<p>They were added to WordPress.com without any announcement. Users were <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/new-smilies" target="_blank">up in arms over the changes to smilies</a>, lamenting that the new emoticons appeared to be <strong>&#8220;cheap and cruel&#8221;</strong> in their expressions. Members described them as <strong>&#8220;hostile&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;full of teeth.&#8221;</strong> That support thread is a gem in terms of WordPress smiley history, with several members resorting to verse in order to express dissatisfaction with the new emoticons.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:23" target="_blank">proposed</a> that WordPress revert to the old smilies and instead make it easier for plugin developers to add custom smiley packs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I suggest we go back to the old smilies in core, and have a canonical plugin for switching smilies that ships with as many open source smiley packs as possible. If we need a filter to do this more elegantly, let&#8217;s add it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Tango/GNOME smilies were then <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10145#comment:27" target="_blank">reverted</a> to the old ones:</p>\n<div id="attachment_19753" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-revert.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19730]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-revert.jpg" alt="Tango/GNOME smilies reverted" width="806" height="255" class="size-full wp-image-19753" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tango/GNOME smilies reverted</p></div>\n<p>As a result, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.9" target="_blank">WordPress 2.9</a>, released in December of 2009, introduced the &#8216;<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Smilies#How_Can_I_Have_Different_Smiley_Images_Appear.3F" target="_blank">smilies_src</a>&#8216; filter so plugins could better add custom smilies.</p>\n<h3>Smiley Wars Part 2: The Demand for Retina Smilies</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-comparison1.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19730]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-comparison1.jpg" alt="smilies-comparison" width="800" height="289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19723" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970" target="_blank">Ticket #24970</a> revives the smiley debate, five years later, proposing that WordPress update the emoticons to be suitable for retina displays. Several commenters on the ticket are in favor of using the new WordPress.com smilies, which is already a possibility thanks to a <a href="http://wptavern.com/give-wordpress-smilies-a-face-lift-new-plugin-adds-wordpress-com-emoticons-to-self-hosted-sites" target="_blank">plugin</a> created by Janneke Van Dorpe.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, author of the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/10145/srcurl.diff" target="_blank">smilies_src filter patch</a> applied during the Tango/GNOME era, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970#comment:11" target="_blank">voiced his renewed opposition</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>-100 for including them in core. I love my existing smilies and will not be changing them.<br />\nIf you want to include them as an option and thus add a new configuration setting, sure. But changing the actual content of my site to something else will draw my ire same as it did when you tried it before.<br />\nNothing personal, but these are just as bad as the last time this was attempted. They look *wrong*.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Smilies Are Content</h4>\n<p>Otto goes on to suggest that if people want the new emoticons, they should be added to Jetpack or another plugin instead of forcing the new designs on WordPress users. He <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970#comment:13" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like it or not, those smilies are content. If you&#8217;re going to change them, you need to make sure you don&#8217;t change them on existing content without permission. That tends to tick people off&#8230;</p>\n<p>What I don&#8217;t want is for you to put them in core and thus arbitrarily rewrite the last X years of existing posts I already have to have these hideous new things instead.<br />\nRespect the content, respect the history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The prospect of updating the emoticons means that WordPress users will either be forced to use the new smilies or use a plugin to revert them back.</p>\n<p>This debate highlights a hardware difference among WordPress users. Those using devices with retina displays are generally on board with updating the emoticons, since the current ones appear to be blurry. Supporters see new emoticons as a necessity of the modern era. WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970#comment:16" target="_blank">commented</a> on the benefits of updating the emoticons to a more modern set:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress would benefit from HiDPI smilies. We would also benefit from shipping smilies that were designed in the last decade. But the fact is, there&#8217;s a lot of existing buy-in for something to change here. These smilies, if nothing else, provide a strong starting base.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In response to the possibility of core emoticons being up for change, Otto released a new plugin today called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-smilies" target="_blank">Classic Smilies</a>, in order to future-proof content against core changes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems that to prevent core from stepping on my content I now have no choice but to run preventative-measure plugins like these,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just a darned shame, in my opinion.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Changing Smilies is No Small Thing</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970" target="_blank">ticket</a> for retina smilies is now home to a hot debate on where WordPress will go next in its support for emoticons. Any proposed changes will affect millions of users. If the Tango/GNOME smilies incident taught us anything, it&#8217;s that a healthy community discussion is valuable in understanding the implications of any proposed change.</p>\n<p>Big deal, they&#8217;re just smiley images, you might say. But smilies have a wider impact than we realize. They&#8217;re woven throughout posts and comments as part of a conversation and sometimes provide critical context for a discussion, much in the same way that images/media do. As one WordPress.com user commented five years ago, &#8220;Those little niceties can go a long way towards creating a pleasant comment thread.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A drastic change to smilies affects the tone of previous conversations. One might even argue that changing the face of the emoticons rewrites the history contained in older posts. In some cases this affects 10+ years worth of content. However, the number of years and posts affected doesn&#8217;t really matter. The fact is that millions of WordPress blogs are positively riddled with smilies. An update that forcibly changes this content may not be well-received.</p>\n<p>But how long can WordPress continue to ship emoticons that appear blurry as technology advances? The advent of retina displays has created an irresistible pull on software to support this technology. Modernizing WordPress for better use on all devices was one of the important factors in 3.8&#8242;s updated admin design. In this fast-moving digital age, a sentimental attachment to old designs is a death knell for any software.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t likely that WordPress will add options for users to choose their smiley package, given its core <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/" target="_blank">philosophy</a> of &#8220;Decisions, not Options&#8221;. Those who oppose updating the smilies to new ones will fight tooth and nail to keep them out, even if that means removing emoticons from the core altogether. How will this community-driven project solve the smiley dilemma?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 01:56:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"WPTavern: Give WordPress Smilies a Face Lift: New Plugin Adds WordPress.com Emoticons to Self-Hosted Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=19694";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:254:"http://wptavern.com/give-wordpress-smilies-a-face-lift-new-plugin-adds-wordpress-com-emoticons-to-self-hosted-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=give-wordpress-smilies-a-face-lift-new-plugin-adds-wordpress-com-emoticons-to-self-hosted-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2059:"<p>Are you in love with the new <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-gets-new-standard-and-secret-emoticons" target="_blank">WordPress.com smilies</a>?

WordPress currently supports oEmbeds for Qik but they will be <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27302" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27302">removed in WordPress 3.9</a>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_19699" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AuthorizeYouTubeQik.png" rel="prettyphoto[19671]"><img class="size-large wp-image-19699" alt="Step One In Moving Qik Videos To YouTube" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AuthorizeYouTubeQik-500x190.png" width="500" height="190" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Step One In Moving Qik Videos To YouTube</p></div>\n<p>To save your videos, Qik recommends <a title="http://support.qik.com/entries/305417-How-can-I-download-Qik-videos-to-my-computer-" href="http://support.qik.com/entries/305417-How-can-I-download-Qik-videos-to-my-computer-">downloading them</a> and either storing them on a local storage medium or on <a title="https://skydrive.live.com/" href="https://skydrive.live.com/">SkyDrive</a> if you have a Microsoft account. Alternatively, you can use the <a title="http://support.qik.com/entries/310862-Sharing-to-YouTube" href="http://support.qik.com/entries/310862-Sharing-to-YouTube">YouTube feature</a> to move videos to YouTube. Videos that are embedded into posts or pages will soon show a <strong>video currently not available</strong> error. In April, the embedded flash player and videos will be removed. Whether it&#8217;s a video URL or the embed code, both will need to be removed from posts to prevent passive errors from showing in browsers.</p>\n<h3>The Best Time To Own Your Content Is Now</h3>\n<p><a title="http://mashable.com/2011/01/06/skype-acquires-qik-rumor/" href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/06/skype-acquires-qik-rumor/">According to Mashable</a>, Qik&#8217;s userbase reached 5 million users in 2010. With that many users, it&#8217;s inevitable a lot of videos will be lost forever, never to be viewed again. This is the risk anyone takes when they host their content on a third-party site instead of <a title="http://wpshout.com/own-your-content-wordpress/" href="http://wpshout.com/own-your-content-wordpress/">owning it</a>. This holds true no matter how large and or successful a service becomes.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say you shouldn&#8217;t use YouTube or any other third-party service. They&#8217;re a great asset to the web and give people access to an incredibly large and diverse audience. My rule of thumb is to always have a backup copy of your original works and do not trust a third-party to have your best interests in mind.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 18:30:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: Casper: A Free Ghost-Style WordPress Theme Based on Underscores";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=19657";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:188:"http://wptavern.com/casper-a-free-ghost-style-wordpress-theme-based-on-underscores?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=casper-a-free-ghost-style-wordpress-theme-based-on-underscores";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2640:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/casper.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19657]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/casper.jpg" alt="casper" width="838" height="349" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19659" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://lacymorrow.com/projects/casper/" target="_blank">Casper</a> is a new theme for WordPress that is essentially a port of the default blogging theme for <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a>. Lacy Morrow built the theme using <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a> as a base. Morrow said that the goal for his theme was to approximate Ghost&#8217;s default theme while incorporating WordPress-specific features:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The goal of this project is to emulate the gorgeous theme while taking advantage of features exclusive to the WordPress framework.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Responsive images in the theme are handled by a lightweight (1kb) <a href="https://github.com/kvendrik/responsive-images.js" target="_blank">script</a> that utilizes image replacement to load the correct image size for the visitor&#8217;s device.</p>\n<p>The ability to add your own social URLs is built into the customizer, along with a handful of other options that enable you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload your own logo</li>\n<li>Add a custom background image</li>\n<li>Customize the header background, text, link and hover colors</li>\n<li>Options to display header on all pages, make logo circular and frame logo image</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While testing the theme, I noticed the header disappears on single posts. I&#8217;m not sure if its disappearance is a ghost-like feature or a bug. However, if you go into the customizer and select to display the header on all pages, the problem is easily solved.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://lacymorrow.com/projects/casper/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Casper to see it in action. The theme also includes specific styling for quotes and code blocks. Morrow created the demo content using Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown module</a>, but Markdown is not required in order to use the theme.</p>\n<p>Casper is a fast-loading super minimalist WordPress theme that you can easily customize to add your own personality. <a href="https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper-wp" target="_blank">Download</a> it from github and upload the casper-wp folder to your WordPress themes directory. If you&#8217;d like to report a bug, request a feature or contribute to the code, get in touch with <a href="http://lacymorrow.com/" target="_blank">Lacy Morrow</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 04:27:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: Help Contribute To The Official WordPress Developer Resource By Testing Code References";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=19214";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:238:"http://wptavern.com/help-contribute-to-the-official-wordpress-developer-resource-by-testing-code-references?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=help-contribute-to-the-official-wordpress-developer-resource-by-testing-code-references";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2738:"<p>Announced at WordCamp San Francisco during Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_Saklwq48" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_Saklwq48">State of The Word 2013 </a>presentation, <a title="http://developer.wordpress.org/" href="http://developer.wordpress.org/">developer.wordpress.org</a> will host educational tools for developers in the form of handbooks and code referencing material.</p>\n<p>It will be the go-to place to discover WordPress best practices.

height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19647" /></a></p>\n<p>Emoticons are believed to have been <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2011/09/happy-birthday-emoticon/" target="_blank">invented in 1982</a> by Scott Fahlman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who suggested that they be used on &#8220;computer bulletin boards.&#8221; Though not widely used at that time, emoticon usage exploded with the popularity of AOL’s Instant Messenger in the 1990&#8242;s.</p>\n<p>Now, more than 30 years later, emoticons are still going strong thanks to text and chat applications. They&#8217;re also still widely used in blogs. In fact, WordPress.com just gave their smilies a <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/new-emoticons/" target="_blank">redesign</a> to be &#8220;cleaner, simpler, bigger, more expressive, and modern.&#8221; The new emoticons were created to use vector graphics, which means that when you zoom in or view them on retina displays, they will still display beautifully.</p>\n<h3>Standard and Secret Emoticons on WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/smilies/" target="_blank">smilies documentation</a> includes all your standard updated smilies:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-standard.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19326]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-standard.jpg" alt="smilies-standard" width="682" height="119" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19637" /></a></p>\n<p>You can turn them on by navigating to <strong>Settings > Writing Settings</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smiley-settings.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19326]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smiley-settings.jpg" alt="smiley-settings" width="742" height="148" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19349" /></a></p>\n<p>Although there is no smiley-chooser interface in the post editor, hovering over an emoticon in use on WordPress.com will display a tooltip with the necessary code to make that particular smiley. Additionally, most of the smilies also work with dashes for noses.</p>\n<p>At the end of the <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/new-emoticons/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Automattic designer Joen Asmussen hints at the existence of secret smileys: <strong>&#8220;We also created a few secret emoticons for you to discover. Good luck finding them! ;)&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s no easy way to discover the secret ones unless someone shows you. The following are the secret smilies, as originally <a href="http://jannekevandorpe.com/2014/03/19/secret-new-wordpress-smileys/" target="_blank">posted</a> by Janneke Van Dorpe. They are undoubtedly a tribute to the fuel that powers WordPress.com developers:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-secret.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[19326]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smilies-secret.jpg" alt="smilies-secret" width="399" height="95" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19638" /></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you make them:</p>\n<pre>(W) &gt;-I |_| :developer: :burrito:</pre>\n<p>The design team at WordPress.com is working on expanding the collection of smilies, so there will be more to add to this list in the future.</p>\n<h3>Will Self-Hosted WordPress Sites Get Updated Emoticons?</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a self-hosted WordPress site owner who is swooning over the new emoticons, you&#8217;ll be glad to know that there is a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24970" target="_blank">ticket to update emoticons</a> in core, originally opened eight months ago. WordPress needs retina-ready smilies, but it&#8217;s not yet clear whether the new WordPress.com emoticons are a good option.</p>\n<p>However, the new, modernized smilies have put this ticket back on everyone&#8217;s radar and we may see some action on it in the near feature. It looks like smilies are here to stay.

We all sat around a table and they let me rant while I worked to understand their documentation, tested their APIs, and discussed what could improve the developer experience. They took copious notes, had great questions, and were even deploying adjustments on the fly.</p>\n<p>In talking to GSA&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/gbinal">Gray Brooks</a>, I learned dozens of federal agencies are lining up for these review sessions. It&#8217;s an exciting time to be a consumer of government data, and it makes me really happy that they&#8217;re encouraging citizens to actively shape this process. It was obvious how helpful it was for these government technologists to hear an outside perspective. If your local government is on the path of “Gov 2.0” see if you can offer even just a little bit of your time to share your expertise.</p>\n<p>Unlike someone like <a href="https://konklone.com/">Eric Mill</a> of <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight</a> (who also gave a round of feedback yesterday), I&#8217;m not a regular consumer of government APIs. But as a lead developer of WordPress, a citizen, and a taxpayer, I feel very strongly about an open, transparent, and efficient government; open government data; and an open web enriched by accessible APIs.</p>\n<address>You can follow the GSA&#8217;s efforts at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18f.gsa.gov</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/18f">@18f</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/18f">GitHub</a>. For the record, the U.S. agencies were <a href="http://www.foreignassistance.gov/">ForeignAssistance.gov</a> (<a href="http://www.state.gov/">State</a>/<a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a>), <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">FEMA</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a>.</address>\n<address><strong>Bonus: </strong>About three years ago, when <a href="http://ben.balter.com/">Ben Balter</a> was at the FCC, he wrote an <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/developers/api-terms-of-service">API Terms of Service</a> that was heavily inspired by WordPress.com&#8217;s own <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/">TOS</a>. Ben is now a government evangelist at GitHub — where you <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">can now find</a> WordPress.com&#8217;s TOS.

Not only did I upgrade, but I also enabled the <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/sso/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/sso/">single-sign on Jetpack module</a> for WPTavern.com and <a title="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> for my WordPress.com user account. Within the comments of the post, <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-4-0-available-new-and-improved-stats#comment-53431" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-4-0-available-new-and-improved-stats#comment-53431">Jonathan Lyman mentioned</a> WordPress For iOS is incompatible with two-factor authentication:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just a small heads up for those who’ve never used the WordPress for iOS app before. If one has a two-factor authentication plugin active, the WordPress app will not be able to login to a self-hosted site.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>WordPress App Doesn&#8217;t Accept Login Credentials To WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>When trying to manage my self-hosted WordPress site within the app, I repeatedly received prompts to login to WordPress.com. Using the same password I use on my desktop didn&#8217;t work. No matter what I tried, I couldn&#8217;t successfully login to WordPress.com from within the mobile app.</p>\n<p>However, if I was quick enough, I could still browse comment notifications, create new posts, etc. I determined that only items within the app that require an authenticated connection to WordPress.com stopped functioning. While browsing the support forum, I discovered forum threads where other users<a title="http://ios.forums.wordpress.org/topic/cannot-login-with-ipad-app-self-hosted-2fa?replies=9" href="http://ios.forums.wordpress.org/topic/cannot-login-with-ipad-app-self-hosted-2fa?replies=9"> reported login issues</a> using two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h3>How I Solved The Problem</h3>\n<p>I logged out of WordPress.com using my desktop. I logged back in using my desktop, used the keycode given to me by the <a title="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/#setup-with-google-authenticator" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/#setup-with-google-authenticator">Google Authenticator app</a> and now,  stats work, as does the rest of the app without pestering me to login to WordPress.com.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2FAGoogleAuthenticator.png" rel="prettyphoto[19616]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19625" alt="Google Authenticator" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2FAGoogleAuthenticator-500x343.png" width="500" height="343" /></a></p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re repeatedly asked to login to WordPress.com after enabling two-factor authentication, I&#8217;d try logging out of WordPress.com using your desktop and login again. Then determine if the app detects your validated connection to WordPress.com. This solved the problem for me.</p>\n<p>If you still experience issues related to two-factor authentication, please report them using the <a title="http://ios.forums.wordpress.org/" href="http://ios.forums.wordpress.org/">WordPress For iOS Support forum</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone else gone through the same experience after enabling two-factor authentication?</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 17:19:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"WordPress.tv: Interview de Emilie Lebrun, oratrice de “Etude de cas : Bus Open Tour, un multisite e-commerce …”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33747";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:121:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/24/interview-de-emilie-lebrun-oratrice-de-etude-de-cas-bus-open-tour-un-multisite-e-commerce/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:711:"<div id="v-gLglGkJL-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33747/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33747/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33747&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/24/interview-de-emilie-lebrun-oratrice-de-etude-de-cas-bus-open-tour-un-multisite-e-commerce/"><img alt="05 &#8211;

The upcoming version 8 will add <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2014/03/wordpress-support-in-phpstorm-8-eap/" target="_blank">official support for WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>According to a recent <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/best-php-ide-2014-survey-results/">survey</a> conducted by SitePoint, PhpStorm is by far the most favored IDE among PHP developers in 2014. It captured the vote of nearly 40% surveyed, followed by Sublime Text (18.5%) and NetBeans (15.6%). PhpStorm was the clear all-around winner for both business and personal use, due to its speed, strong community, and support for a wide variety of languages and frameworks.</p>\n<p>PhpStorm has supported Drupal and other PHP frameworks for a couple of years and is now finally adding WordPress-specific development features. Version 8 will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress integration in PhpStorm for new plugins (with plugin skeleton) and existing projects</li>\n<li>WordPress code style</li>\n<li>Development environment configuration for WordPress</li>\n<li>Hooks support (Completion for registration functions parameters; Navigation from hook registration functions to hook invocation; Callbacks from hook registration; and other hooks-related features)</li>\n<li>Search on WordPress.org right from the editor</li>\n<li>WordPress command line tool WP-CLI integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to give it a test run, version 8 is currently available via the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/PhpStorm+Early+Access+Program" target="_blank">PhpStorm Early Access Program</a>. New users will appreciate the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/WordPress+Development+using+PhpStorm" target="_blank">full tutorial</a> for configuring your development environment for WordPress projects. It will walk you through creating a new plugin and also has instructions for enabling WordPress integration for existing PhpStorm

href="http://wpiphone.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/wordpress-for-ios-4-0-released/">has been released</a>. Stats are now a native component, improving their look and feel on devices running iOS. While I didn&#8217;t have a problem with the traditional web view, the native view is a considerable improvement. Being a native component has also given the stats a noticeable speed improvement when loading.</p>\n<p>Prior to upgrading, my WordPress app started to show me connected to the same site multiple times. I also encountered an issue where the comment notification bubble wouldn&#8217;t reset to zero. Instead, it kept rising. Upgrading to 4.0 fixed both problems. The team says <a title="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues?milestone=15&state=open" href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues?milestone=15&state=open">4.0.1</a> is dedicated to the cleanup of code, bug fixes, and minor tweaks. This will pave the way for the team to tackle media management in 4.1.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve upgraded to 4.0, let us know what you think. Is there anything in particular you&#8217;d like to see in 4.1 with regards to media management?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 16:04:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 09:06:08 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"147097";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 08:45:13 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20140328160853";}', 'no');

BuddyPress core developer Boone Gorges announced the beta and summarized new features and changes that will be important for you to test. This release will introduce a handful of new admin tools for managing BP communities:  User profile data can be edited in the admin: Dashboard &gt; Users Non-multisite installations can ham/spam users: Dashboard &gt; Users New admin screen for managing signups: Dashboard &gt; Users &gt; Pending BuddyPress tools menu has new tools for correcting data that occasionally gets out of sync: Dashboard &gt; Tools &gt; BuddyPress  One front-end feature that should be tested is the synchronization of blog-related activity comments with blog comments. If a user replies to a new blog post activity item, that activity reply will also post back to the blog as a comment. This helps to keep the conversation synchronized in both places. Those are the most visible items to test. However, a large portion of the updates in this release are non-visible improvements under the hood. This includes performance improvements for object caching and pre-caching of activity-related data, a new API for registering xprofile field types, and rewritten metadata functions that now use WordPress’ core metadata API. Refer to Boone Gorges’ beta announcement post for more details on what to test. If you have some free time this weekend or can dedicate some time in the coming week, give BuddyPress 2.0 Beta 1 a test drive. Please report any bugs to the BuddyPress trac.''>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.0 Beta 1: Ready for Testing</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://buddypress.org/2014/03/buddypress-2-0-beta-1-is-now-available/'' title=''The first beta for BuddyPress 2.0 is now ready for testing! BuddyPress 2.0 is shaping up to be a very exciting upgrade, and is currently on track for our an on-time release in mid-April. But we need your help! If you are a plugin or theme developer, or if you are running a BuddyPress site and you have a development/sandbox environment available, please download the 2.0-beta1 zip or get a copy via Subversion, and put it through its paces. We’ll have more details about the changes in our official release documents, but in the meantime, here’s a quick overview of some of the largest changes that need attention. (For a complete list, see this report). First, user-facing stuff:  We have a number of new administrative tools:  User Extended Profile data is now editable at Dashboard &gt; [Network Admin &gt;] Users Non-Multisite installations can now perform spam actions from Dashboard &gt; Users Dashboard &gt; Tools &gt; BuddyPress contains a number of tools for correcting data that occasionally gets out of sync on BP installs   In addition, signups/registrations have been completely overhauled. There is now a subsection on Dashboard &gt; [Network Admin &gt;] Users for handling Pending users, where you can resend activation emails, perform manual activations, and more. The way BP integrates with WP’s signup system under the hood has also been rewritten; on non-Multisite, we now mimic WPMS’s wp_signups functionality. We thinkhttps://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4551 this is a much more flexible, consistent system for all users of BuddyPress. These new workflows need the particular attention of people who are currently administrators on BP sites with open registration – you will best understand the pain points that these changes are meant to address. Blog-related activity comments now sync back to the source blog. That is, a reply in the activity stream to a “Boone posted a new blog post” item will create a corresponding comment on the blog post itself.  There have been extensive changes under the hood, including large performance increases and new developer tools:  Activity actions – strings in the activity stream like “Boone and Ray are now friends” – are no longer (only) stored statically in the database, but are generated dynamically at runtime. This should alleviate several longtime headaches related to data staleness and multilingual sites. But it has also resulted in a number of changes related to the pre-caching of activity-related data. Watch http://bpdevel.wordpress.com in the upcoming days for a discussion of what plugin developers will need to know about the new system (short version – plugins that insert activity items will continue to work as before, but should be good citizens and update to the new technique). See #3856 for background. There’s a brand new API for registering xprofile field types, and our own field types have been completely rewritten to use it. See #5220. User last_activity data has been moved from the usermeta table to the activity table. This ought to result in very sizable performance improvements for larger sites. Plugin developers should verify that their plugins are working correctly with these changes. See this post on bpdevel for more background and specifics. Major improvements have taken place with respect to object caching throughout BuddyPress. If you use Memcached, APC, or some other persistent object caching backend on your BuddyPress site, please consider testing this beta. Metadata functions have been completely rewritten to leverage WP’s core metadata API. See #4551 and especially #5399 for what plugin devs will need to know about backward compatibility.  If you think you’ve found a bug, please report it to the support forums or our development tracker. And remember, this is beta software – we don’t recommend that you run it on a production site. Thanks in advance for your help – onward we march to 2.0!''>BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.0 Beta 1 is now available</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-143-something-to-smiley-about?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=wpweekly-episode-143-something-to-smiley-about'' title=''Sarah Gooding and I debated whether or not smilies are content and what the true focus of debate should be concerning the emoticons.

It was a job I thought I could never get fired from, and one that allowed me to make an easy living. But as time went on, I realized what my father and mother did for a living was more important than just selling insurance.\r\n\r\nOne day, my father did something that would alter my life forever. He told me to put on a suit and tie because we were going to an appointment. I asked my father what the appointment was about. "You will see," he said. When we arrived, my father knocked on the door and a women answered. They began to hug and a few seconds later the woman began to cry uncontrollably as my father consoled her. It turned out her husband had died a few weeks earlier. Seeing my father give her $100,000 could not bring her husband back, but it took some weight off her shoulders regarding how she would pay for her bills, her mortgage and especially the funeral. I saw my father become more than just an insurance agent. I saw him become my hero!\r\n\r\nOn that day, I became aware of how important it was to be insured and more importantly, why my father took so much pride in helping people. So I opened my own agency at the age of 21 in November, 1999. Today, my agency has been ranked in the top 3% in the nation with Farmers Insurance more than once (Championship Award Winner). And I take pride in what I do. I want be one of the best agents in Texas!\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Home', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'home', '', '', '2014-03-22 03:58:17', '2014-03-22 03:58:17', '', 0, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=18', 1, 'page', '', 0);

Your insurance company should notify you by mail when it’s time to renew the policy and to pay your premium.', 'Auto', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'auto', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:26:18', '2014-03-29 10:26:18', '', 24, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=32', 1, 'page', '', 0);

You will be paying insurance on your home for as long as you own it, so you should factor the cost of insurance into the home-buying process. You don’t want to find out that your dream home is more expensive to insure than you thought—after you own it!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU START LOOKING FOR A HOME\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThinking through all the costs associated with buying a home will make the process run more smoothly, and it may also save you money. It is important to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Check Your Credit Rating</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA good credit history helps you in many ways. Good credit makes it easier to get a mortgage at a competitive rate, and it may also qualify you for a good credit discount on your insurance. Make sure you know your credit rating before you apply for a mortgage. Get a copy of one or all of your credit reports. Make sure they are accurate and report any mistakes immediately. If your credit is not as good as it could be take steps now to improve it. The I.I.I. has information on <a href="http://www2.iii.org/individuals/credit">credit and insurance</a> to help you with this process\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Protect Yourself with a Renters Insurance Policy</em></strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are currently renting a house or apartment, protect yourself financially with a <a href="http://www.iii.org/articles/can-i-get-insurance-if-i-rent-my-home.html">renters insurance policy</a>. This provides insurance protection in the event a fire, hurricane or other insured disaster damages or destroys your personal possessions. It also covers the cost of additional living expenses if something happens to make your rental home or apartment unlivable. Additionally, renters insurance gives you liability protection if someone is injured in your home and decides to sue you. Disasters happen, and it would be unfortunate to have to use the down payment you saved to buy your new home to pay for losses that could have been covered by renters insurance. Furthermore, having a renters insurance policy provides a useful insurance history to your prospective homeowners insurer when you go to buy your first home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWHILE HOUSE HUNTING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs you search for your new home, remember that the physical characteristics of the house—its size, location, construction and overall condition—can affect the cost, choice and availability of home insurance. Following are some factors to consider when shopping for a home:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Quality and Location of the Fire Department</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses that are located near highly-rated, permanently staffed fire departments usually cost less to insure. This also holds true for homes that have a hydrant nearby. An important underwriting criterion for insurance companies is a community’s investment in fire protection, which includes trained firefighters, proper equipment and adequate supplies of water.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Proximity to the Coastline</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses located on or near the coast will generally cost more to insure than those further inland. There will also likely be a <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm">hurricane or windstorm deductible</a>. This is a percentage deductible based on the cost to rebuilding a home, rather than a flat dollar amount. With a homeowners policy that has a $500 standard deductible, for example, the policyholder pays the first $500 of the claim before insurance kicks in. However, as percentage deductibles are based on the home’s insured value, if a house is insured for $100,000 and has a 2 percent deductible, the first $2,000 of a claim is paid out of the policyholder’s pocket.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wind damage deductibles: hurricane deductibles, which apply to damage solely from hurricanes; and windstorm or wind/hail deductibles, which apply to any kind of wind damage. Percentage deductibles typically vary by state and range from 1 percent to 5 percent of a home’s insured value. These come into effect if certain triggers occur—a deductible triggering event can be, for instance, an official National Weather Service declaration that a storm is generating hurricane-strength winds (i.e., 74 miles per hour, or more) in your community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn coastal areas with high wind risk, some homeowners may select higher hurricane deductibles to lower their insurance premiums, but that means they pay more if their home is damaged. In some coastal communities, private homeowners insurance coverage may not be readily available. Instead, you may need to purchase insurance through a state-run insurance program, which can provide less coverage, and in some cases be more costly, than private insurance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Age of the Home</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA stately, older home can be quite beautiful, but ornate features such as plaster walls, ceiling molding and wooden floors may be costly to replace and raise the cost of insurance. Plumbing and electrical systems can become unsafe with age and lack of maintenance. So, older homes may cost more to insure. If you are considering buying an older home find out how much it will cost to update these features and factor it into the cost of ownership.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Condition of the Roof</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk about the condition of the roof. A new roof matters to insurers and keeps you and your family safer. Depending on the type of roof and whether or not you use fire and/or hail resistant materials, you may even qualify for a discount. Talk to your insurer about qualifying discounts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Is the Home Well-Built and Up to Code?</em></strong>\r\n\r\nFind out whether the house has been updated to comply with current building codes. Homes built by careful craftsmen and those built to meet modern engineering-based building codes are likely to better withstand natural disasters. Consider hiring a licensed home inspector who is knowledgeable about the latest building codes to inspect the property before you sign a mortgage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Risk of Flooding</em></strong>\r\n\r\nDamage from flooding is NOT covered by standard home insurance policies. If you are buying a home in an area at risk from flooding, you will need to purchase separate insurance. Insurance for flooding is available from the federal government’s <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers. People often underestimate the risk of flooding. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the NFIP. More important is that 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses for flooding are for damage in areas not officially designated as special flood hazard areas. If you are not in a high-risk flood zone, NFIP coverage is available at a lower premium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>History of Earthquakes </em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile earthquakes are most frequently associated with California, they have occurred in 39 states and, like flooding, are not covered under standard home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is available from private insurers as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, and in California from the <a href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/">California Earthquake Authority</a>, a privately funded, publicly managed organization.  The cost of earthquake insurance differs widely by location, insurer and the type of structure being covered. Generally, older buildings cost more to insure than new ones. Wood frame structures may benefit from lower rates than brick buildings because they tend to withstand quake stresses better. Regions are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 for likelihood of quakes, and this difference is reflected in insurance rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Swimming Pool or Other Special Feature</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the house has a swimming pool, hot tub or other special feature, you will likely need more liability insurance. You may also want to consider purchasing an excess or umbrella liability policy to provide added protection in the event someone gets injured on your property and decides to sue you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID ON THE HOME</h3>\r\n<strong><em>Check the Loss History Report</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk the current owner of the house for a copy of the insurance loss history report, such as a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.) report from ChoicePoint or an A-PLUS report from ISO, a leading source of information about property/casualty insurance. This is a record of insurance claims on the house that can provide answers to two questions that any savvy homebuyer should ask:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Have there been any past problems in the home?</li>\r\n	<li>If damage has occurred, was it properly repaired?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote that prior claims are not a barrier to getting insurance. In fact, sometimes a recent claim can have positive ramifications. If, for example, a roof was damaged by a wind storm and replaced by a new one, this would make the house more desirable to an insurance company. If there have been no claims within five years, there will be no loss history report on the home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Get the House Inspected</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nA thorough inspection of the home is very important. The inspector should:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>check the general condition of the home;</li>\r\n	<li>look for water damage, termites and other types of infestation;</li>\r\n	<li>pay special attention to the electrical system, septic tank and water heater;</li>\r\n	<li>show you where potential problems might develop;</li>\r\n	<li>double-check that past problems have been repaired;</li>\r\n	<li>suggest upgrades or replacements that may be needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>If the inspector raises questions, your insurance company will as well. And, be sure to find out if there is an underground oil storage tank, as many insurers will not provide policies for homes that have one.</div>\r\n<div><strong><em>Determine How Much It Will Cost to Maintain the House</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>Routine maintenance is your responsibility as a homeowner. Losses caused by failing to properly care for your home are not covered by standard homeowners insurance policies. The yearly cost of taking care of your house is another factor to be included in the overall price of owning the home.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><strong><em>Call Your Insurance Representative</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong></div>\r\n<div>Don’t wait until the last minute to think about insurance. Ask your insurance professional if the house will qualify for insurance, and get an estimate of the premium. The sooner you act, the smoother the process will be. Don’t be shy about asking for estimates on more than one house. Insurance is an important consideration when purchasing a home. If you are uncomfortable with the cost of insuring a particular house, keep looking for one that better fits your financial situation. If you do not already have an insurance agent or company representative, get recommendations from family, friends or co-workers, or consult your <a href="http://www2.iii.org/StateOrganizations/">state insurance department</a>.</div>\r\n<div></div>', 'Home', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'home', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:25:47', '2014-03-29 10:25:47', '', 24, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=34', 2, 'page', '', 0);

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(38, 1, '2014-03-21 15:13:34', '2014-03-21 15:13:34', 'Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to property and liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDamage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage is provided by the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program, although it is purchased from an insurance agent. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a separate policy. Most maintenance related problems are the homeowners’ responsibility.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of coverage. They include:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Coverage for the structure of the home</strong>\r\nThis part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy. It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear. Most standard policies also cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Coverage for personal belongings</strong>\r\nFurniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most companies provide coverage for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of the policy includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world, unless the policyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive items like jewelry, furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are stolen. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised value.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTrees, plants and shrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insurance—generally up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, lightning, explosion, vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or disease.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Liability protection</strong>\r\nLiability covers against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that policyholders or family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards—up to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. An umbrella or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, including claims for libel and slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to the policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Additional living expenses</strong>\r\nThis pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabitable due to damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals and other living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to company.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies</strong>\r\nThe different types of homeowners policies are fairly standard throughout the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different or go by other names such as “standard" or “deluxe." The one exception is the state of Texas, where policies vary somewhat from policies in other states. The Texas Insurance Department (<a href="http://www.tdi.state.tx.us/" type="Url">http://www.tdi.state.tx.us</a> ) has detailed information on its various homeowners policies.\r\n\r\nPeople who own the home they live in have several policies to choose from. The most popular policy is the HO-3. It provides coverage for the structure of the home and personal belongings as well as personal liability coverage. It also provides the broadest coverage, protecting against 16 disasters or perils listed below.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fire or lightning</li>\r\n	<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\r\n	<li>Explosion</li>\r\n	<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\r\n	<li>Damage caused by aircraft</li>\r\n	<li>Damage caused by vehicles</li>\r\n	<li>Smoke</li>\r\n	<li>Vandalism or malicious mischief</li>\r\n	<li>Theft</li>\r\n	<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\r\n	<li>Falling object</li>\r\n	<li>Weight of ice, snow or sleet</li>\r\n	<li>Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective sprinkler system, or from a household appliance</li>\r\n	<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system, an air conditioning or automatic fire-protective system</li>\r\n	<li>Freezing of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic, fire-protective sprinkler system, or of a household appliance</li>\r\n	<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current (does not include loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOwners of multifamily homes generally purchase an HO-3 with an endorsement to cover the risks associated with having renters live in their houses. Other types of policies for home owners are the HO2, which provides more limited coverage, the HO-1, a bare bones policy that is not widely available, and the HO-8, designed for older homes. There is also a version of the HO-2 designed for mobile homes.\r\nThe HO4-policy was created specifically for those who rent the home they live in. It covers a policyholder’s belongings against all 16 perils. It also provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents may cause to third parties. The HO-6 policy was designed for owners of condominium and cooperative units. It provides coverage for belongings and the structural parts of the condominium or co-op that the policyholder owns. It protects against all 16 perils and provides personal liability coverage. Both cover additional living expenses.\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nLevels of Coverage</strong>\r\nThere are three coverage options:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Actual Cash Value</strong>\r\nThis policy pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduction for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Replacement Cost</strong>\r\nThis policy pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or replacing possessions without a deduction for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost</strong>\r\nThis policy offers the highest level of protection. A guaranteed replacement cost policy pays whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster—even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally won’t cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help pay for these additional costs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome insurance companies offer an extended, rather than a guaranteed, replacement cost policy. An extended policy pays a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild the home. Generally, it is 20 to 25 percent more than the limit of the policy. For example, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage. Guaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but they offer the best financial protection against disasters for a home. These coverages, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies. Replacement cost coverage is available for the structure of the home, but only actual cash value coverage is available for possessions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Home Owners', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'home-owners', '', '', '2014-03-29 09:58:29', '2014-03-29 09:58:29', '', 34, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=38', 1, 'page', '', 0);

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\r\n	<li>Liability</li>\r\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Personal Possessions</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\r\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Liability</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Additional Living Expenses</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy. The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from. Insurers who offer homeowners insurance generally also sell renters insurance. In fact, a renters insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy are almost identical. The main difference is that a renters policy doesn’t include coverage for the building, since the landlord owns that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Comparison Shop</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPrices vary from company to company, so it pays to shop around. Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet. Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions.  Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks. More discounts might be available depending on your age or whether or not you smoke.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Filing a Renters Insurance Claim</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>REPORT ANY CRIME TO THE POLICE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police. Get a police report and the names of all law enforcement officers with whom you speak.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>CALL (713) 270-0073 TO GET ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS:</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How long to I have to file a claim? (There are time limits on claims filing.)</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have the coverage I need?</li>\r\n	<li>Does my claim exceed my deductible?</li>\r\n	<li>How long will it take to process the claim?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>PREPARE A LIST OF LOST OR DAMAGED ARTICLES</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to substantiate your loss. Don’t throw out damaged items until a claims adjuster has visited\r\nyour home. You should also consider photographing or videotaping the damage. Prepare a list of damaged or stolen items for your adjuster along with copies of receipts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>IF YOU NEED TO RELOCATE, KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your home is severely damaged and you need to find other accommodations while repairs are being\r\nmade, keep records of all expenses.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>GET CLAIM FORMS</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve notified your insurer of your claim, the company is required to send the necessary claim forms to you by the end of a set time period. (The time period varies from state to state.) Return the properly filled out forms as soon as possible to speed up your claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>If you feel your insurer hasn’t given you satisfactory service</strong>, you should talk to the agent or company representative who sold you your policy or your insurer’s claims manager. If you’re still unhappy, contact your state insurance department or local consumer protection office to discuss what you can do.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nState insurance department telephone numbers and Web site addresses can be found <a href="http://www2.iii.org/stateorganizations/">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my bicycle covered by renters insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Your bicycle and other recreational or sports equipment are covered. There are also special policies you can buy for very expensive sports equipment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my car covered?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Vehicles aren’t covered by renters insurance.  You need to get a separate auto insurance policy to drive legally and protect your car, van or motorcycle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents’ insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. If you’re a college student living in a dorm and are still part of your parents’ household, their homeowners or renters insurance provides coverage. If you live off campus, you’ll probably need your own renters policy. Policies can vary, so speak to your insurer about this.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roommate or domestic partner?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Regulations differ from state to state, and policies might also differ from company to company. Find out\r\nwhat regulations apply where you live. Some insurance companies allow unmarried couples who have been living together to buy joint coverage. But a domestic partner is usually not automatically insured, like a husband or wife, under the partner’s policy. He or she must be specifically named.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. What happens if something I have rented or borrowed is stolen?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Items that are “in your possession” are covered under a standard renters policy, whether they are things that you’ve bought, received as gifts or borrowed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my property covered away from home?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Yes, most renters polices include what is called Off-premises coverage.  This means that belongings that are outside of your home are also covered against the same disasters listed in your policy. For example, property stolen from your car would be covered. However, there are generally dollar limits on the amount you can be reimbursed. For example, if you have $25,000 worth of personal possessions insurance, you may be covered for up to $2,500, or 10 percent of the total.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Are my valuables covered by my renters insurance policy?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. In general you are covered for up to $1,500 for jewelry or other expensive items that are destroyed or lost to fire, windstorms, theft or other perils that are listed in your policy.  If your valuables are worth more than that, you should consider purchasing a “floater,” also called an “endorsement,” to increase the amount of coverage.\r\n<strong>\r\nQ. How can I protect my house or apartment against a flood or earthquake?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Renters insurance does not cover floods or earthquakes. Flood coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program (888) 379-9531, www.floodsmart.gov ) and from a few private insurers. You can get this coverage, however, from the same agent or company representative who sold you the renters insurance policy. Earthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an “endorsement” to your renters policy.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Renters', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'renters', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:27:27', '2014-03-29 10:27:27', '', 34, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=165', 3, 'page', '', 0);

Choosing the right insurance policy is much like choosing the right mobile home. You want it to fit your needs and lifestyle, but you also want the insurance coverage to fit within your budget.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese coverage options are available for rental mobile homes, commercial mobile homes, mobile homes that are used seasonally, or mobile homes located in a park or on private property. If you already have auto or homeowners insurance, you can try contacting the same insurer to see if you are eligible for a discount.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Physical Damage</strong></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPhysical damage coverage pays for accidental damage to your mobile home, belongings, or other structures (such as attached patios or decks, garages or storage sheds) resulting from fire, hail, wind, theft and vandalism, or falling objects. The amount and degree of coverage varies from one policy to another, so make sure to compare policies carefully.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome policies only cover specific causes of loss (named peril policies). This is basic coverage and while the low premiums may seem like a bargain, it could cost you hundreds of dollars in the event of a claim, if the damage is not caused by one of the named perils.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGenerally, coverage under a regular policy doesn’t apply while the mobile home is in transit. Also, like regular homeowners insurance, flood is not generally covered, so be sure to find out whether you are in a flood zone and can purchase flood insurance through the <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/" type="Url">National Flood Insurance Program</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Personal Liability Coverage</strong></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDamage to property isn’t the only hazard of modern life. Liability insurance coverage applies when there is a claim or a lawsuit against you after someone is injured or their property is damaged because of your activities. That amount may be more than what comes standard with a mobile home insurance policy, so it may be wise to consider purchasing additional liability insurance. Claims might include medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and even property damage. However, liability coverage does not pay claims for injuries to you or the members of your household.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNot all insurance companies offer mobile home insurance in all states. Check with your agent or insurance company representative to determine the availability of coverage in your state or contact your <a href="http://www2.iii.org/stateorganizations/">state insurance department</a>.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Mobile Home', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mobile-home', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:30:28', '2014-03-29 10:30:28', '', 34, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=167', 4, 'page', '', 0);

Originally, individuals or companies that faced a common <em>peril</em>, formed a group and created a self-help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss (in other words, a mutual insurance arrangement).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe modern system relies on dedicated carriers, usually for-profit, to offer protection against specified perils in consideration of a premium. Liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third party insurance claims, i.e., payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. In general, damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. When a claim is made, the insurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured. The legal costs of a defense normally do not affect policy limits unless the policy expressly states otherwise; this default rule is useful because defense costs tend to soar when cases go to trial.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'General Liability', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'general-liability', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:35:22', '2014-03-29 10:35:22', '', 36, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=169', 1, 'page', '', 0);

It also compensates them for lost wages and provides death benefits for their dependents if they are killed in work-related accidents, including terrorist attacks. The workers compensation system is the “exclusive remedy” for on-the-job injuries suffered by employees. As part of the social contract embedded in each state’s law, the employee gives up the right to sue the employer for injuries caused by the employer’s negligence and in return receives workers compensation benefits regardless of who or what caused the accident, as long as it happened in the workplace as a result of and in the course of workplace activities.\r\n\r\nWorkers compensation systems vary from state to state. State statutes and court decisions control many aspects, including the handling of claims, the evaluation of impairment and settlement of disputes, the amount of benefits injured workers receive and the strategies used to control costs. From 2008 to 2009 maximum income benefits for total disability increased an average 3.67 percent. The average maximum weekly benefit in 2009 was $763.16, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2009 Analysis of Workers Compensation Laws.\r\n\r\nWorkers compensation costs are one of the many factors that influence businesses to expand or relocate in a state, generating jobs. When premiums rise sharply, legislators often call for reforms. The last round of widespread reform legislation started in the late 1980s. In general, the reforms enabled employers and insurers to better control medical care costs through coordination and oversight of the treatment plan and return-to-work process and to improve workplace safety. Some states are now approaching a crisis once again as new problems arise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>National:</strong> According to A.M. Best, workers compensation premiums for 2009 dropped 14.5 percent to $12.3 billion, the lowest level in 10 years, while the combined ratio, the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses, rose 8.8 percentage points to 120 percent. The deterioration in profitability was driven by a continuous decrease in premiums as poor economic conditions reduced the number of people in work force and intense competition for business reduced prices for coverage.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI) released in September 2010 shows that workers compensation payments for medical care and cash benefits that help cover lost wages increased 4.4 percent in 2008, the latest available data, to $57.6 billion. For the first time, but reflecting a long-term growth trend in medical spending for the past 30 years, medical benefits totaled more than half of all benefits paid, driven by an 8.8 percent increase in payments for medical care. The increase in wage replacement payments was minimal (0.3 percent). Overall, employers’ costs declined by 6.7 percent to $78.9 billion. Per $100 of payroll, the basis for computing workers compensation, employer costs in 2008 were $1.33, a 0.11 percent decrease from the previous year. Cash benefits to workers per $100 of payroll dropped 0.01 percent to $0.48. This is the lowest level since 1980, according to NASI.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>State activities:</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Denial of Coverage to Illegal Immigrants: </strong>Bills that would deny workers compensation benefits to illegal aliens who are injured in the workplace appear to have stalled. Legislation was introduced in Georgia, Montana, New Hampshire and South Carolina earlier in the year but has not been enacted in any state.</li>\r\n	<li>Although federal law prohibits knowingly hiring illegal immigrants, once hired, most states do provide workers compensation benefits regardless of immigration status and courts have generally held that such workers are entitled to benefits. In general, insurers are opposed to denying benefits to illegal aliens. First, it runs counter to public policy. Workers compensation laws serve a humanitarian purpose. In addition, denial could encourage unscrupulous employers to seek out illegal aliens, knowing that they could avoid the cost of workers compensation coverage and thus gain a marketplace advantage over their law-abiding competitors. Second, the workers compensation’s exclusive remedy provision protects employers from lawsuits charging them with negligence in the workplace. Without this protection, when workers are injured, whether or not they are illegal aliens, employers are exposed to civil litigation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>North Carolina:</strong> A bill, H.B. 709, is making its way through the legislature. Among other things, it caps payments to a totally disabled worker. The current law, which has no cap so benefits can continue for a lifetime, raises overall costs to the point where the state is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new business relative to states that have different and less costly systems, the bill’s sponsors say. Another provision extends the maximum time death benefits can be paid to dependents and wage benefits can be paid to partially disabled workers.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Illinois:</strong> Shortly before the legislature was to adjourn on May 31, the House passed H.B. 1698 on a second try. The bill aims to curb escalating costs and create a more attractive and competitive business environment by cutting medical fees to doctors and hospitals by 30 percent, for a potential reduction in costs of up to $700 million, lowering the number of weeks workers with carpal tunnel syndrome receive benefits to 28.5 from the current 40, and using AMA guidelines to determine the degree of impairment.</li>\r\n	<li>Costs in Illinois are the third highest in the nation, according to a biannual premium ranking from the Oregon Department of Commerce and Business Services. Only Montana and Alaska have higher costs. The centerpiece of the legislation was cutting payments to doctors and hospitals but initially some lawmakers objected to such steep cuts. Critics say the most serious weakness in the state’s workers compensation system is “causation,” meaning the extent to which injuries are work-related, which the measure did not address. Earlier in the year, the Governor suggested a package of reforms, among them strengthening the causation standard so that only injuries that are held to be more than 50 percent employment-related would be compensable.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Kansas:</strong> In April 2011 Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed into law a bill that makes substantial changes to the workers compensation system, which the Governor characterized as a good compromise between the needs of business and labor. The legislation makes injuries caused by repetitive trauma and occupational disease compensable; strengthens the causation standard so that the work incident is the prevailing factor for an injury to be compensable; clarifies rules governing payments to employers when an employee with pre-existing conditions not related to the current employer’s workplace is injured; and raises benefit caps for workers with various degrees of disability.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Montana:</strong> Also in April Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed a much-brokered major workers compensation reform bill (HB 334) which, the NCCI says, could lower costs by about $100 million. Montana’s system is currently the most expensive, according to the Oregon Department of Commerce and Business Services. The measure terminates medical benefits five years after the date of injury or occupational disease diagnosis, but allows cases related to older injuries to be reviewed every two years and be reopened if justified by medical evidence; freezes the medical fee schedule for two years until mid 2013; and requires disability payments for partial disability to be based on wage loss. To improve return to work rates, “stay at work/return to work” services will be provided.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Oklahoma is one of a handful of states where the courts administer the workers compensation system. Legislation modifying the court system was passed in 2010 and continued in 2011 but critics are aiming to shift the court-based system to an administrative one in the future. In 2011, in a major push to reduce workers compensation costs, legislation developed by a special study group set up by Gov. Mary Fallin was approved by the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 44-0 in March.  Gov. Fallin has called the system’s high costs an obstacle to job creation.</li>\r\n	<li>The bill, SB 878, passed the legislature in May after months of negotiation. The measure would radically change the state’s workers compensation statute, the first major overhaul in more than three decades. Among other things, it tightens the definition of a compensable injury; requires a new medical fees to be developed that would result in an overall reduction in medical care costs of 5 percent; significantly reduces the maximum period during which an injured worker can receive temporary total disability benefits; and requires the use of nationally recognized treatment guidelines to control the type of treatment injured workers receive, standards that are used in Texas and Kansas. In addition, the measure would facilitate a worker’s early return to the workplace through vocational rehabilitation programs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Texas:</strong> Major reforms were enacted in 2005 that transferred responsibility for workers compensation from a commission to the Texas Insurance Department, improved access to healthcare and advice for injured workers, promoted return-to-work programs, created medical treatment guidelines and raised injured workers’ benefits.</li>\r\n	<li>In January 2011 the department published its biennial report on system improvements. Highlights of the report indicate that since 2005, the nonfatal occupational injury/illness rate in the state has decreased 19 percent, from 3.6 to 2.9 injuries per 100 full-time employees (the rate of injury also dropped nationally, see below). The percentage of employers that participate in the program (i.e., became subscribers, see Background section) rose from 62 percent in 2004 to 68 percent in 2010, due mainly to lower premiums, down 40 percent since 2003, and the increased availability of workers compensation healthcare networks. And the percentage of injured employees receiving temporary income benefits who initially returned to work within six months of their injury rose from 74 percent in 2004 to 80 percent in 2009. Of those, 71 percent remained employed for three consecutive quarters compared with 66 percent in 2004.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>California:</strong> Insurance commissioner Dave Jones opposed the suggested 29.6 rate increase requested by the Workers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau.  The bureau’s recommendations are advisory only. The bureau noted that even with the proposed increase, rates would still be 53 percent lower than those in effect on July 1, 2003, the year reforms designed to stabilize the cost of the system were adopted.</li>\r\n	<li>Despite the reduction in cost, many believe that the system is still too litigious. A study by the California Workers Compensation Institute found that between 2000 and 2008 attorneys were involved in nearly 44 percent of all lost time claims (those in which the injury caused time off work) and in more than 86 percent of claims involving permanent disability. The legislative and administrative intent of the 2003/2004 reforms was to eliminate the perceived unpredictability of medical and disability assessments. However, the fine print of the legislation and the implementation and adjudication of the rules and regulations, including inconsistencies in Workers Compensation Appeals Board decisions, have compromised the potential impact of the reforms and led to new types of disputes. These include disagreements as to the conditions that can be defined as eligible for permanent disability benefits and the apportionment of such disability between work-related and non-work-related medical conditions.</li>\r\n	<li>A recent RAND Institute for Civil Justice study commissioned by the California Commission on Health and Safety and Workers Compensation and conducted with Navigant Consulting found that the volatility in the state’s workers compensation market after rates were partially deregulated in 1995 was due largely to inaccurate cost projections. To improve the accuracy of cost projections, researchers recommend that future reform legislation be written in more explicit language and that more comprehensive data be made available on workers compensation claims. In addition, to improve the reliability of actuarial opinions, the California Department of Insurance should consider hiring its own actuaries and then charging insurers for their services to reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest in the preparation of reports and that, to catch insurers likely to fail earlier, the Department should create an early warning system that would trigger mandatory financial examinations. The researchers also suggest that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Risk-Based Capital system, which sets targets for capital (policyholders’ surplus) according to the riskiness of an insurer’s business, is not stringent enough.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>State Funds, Competitive Funds:</strong> Following the successful change over in West Virginia from a state-controlled workers compensation system to a private competitive market, several states, including Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma, all of which have workers compensation entities with some degree of state oversight that compete with the private market, have been looking into some form of privatization. Some impetus for the sale of these entities is the poor local economy and the resulting budget deficits. (Other states are raiding special workers compensation funds where money has been set aside for specific purposes such as paying the claims of insolvent insurers.)</li>\r\n	<li>In Arizona, the legislature has agreed to privatize the State Compensation Fund, requiring the transaction to be completed by 2013. The fund had a market share of 31.5 percent in 2009, according to the state’s department of insurance.</li>\r\n	<li>In Oklahoma CompSource, which insures about 35 percent of the market, has a 5 percent advantage over private insurers because it does not pay premium taxes. A legislative task force studying the options voted 5 to 4 in favor of creating a mutual company, but the idea was dropped when opponents said that it would result in higher premiums for small businesses.  Most of the businesses in the state are small, with 98 percent having fewer than 100 workers and 75 percent having fewer than 10, according to the State Chamber of Oklahoma.</li>\r\n	<li>In Colorado Pinnacol Assurance, a quasi-mutual company with almost 60 percent of the market, is also exempt from premiums taxes. A legislative committee charged with reviewing the feasibility of Pinnacol’s continued operation as a division of state government or of selling it to a third party recommended a number of measures, including changing it to a mutual company that would still serve as a market of last resort. But the proposal failed to gain enough support.</li>\r\n	<li>In Washington State, which has a monopolistic state fund, a ballot initiative that would have led to opening the market to private competition was defeated in the November 2010 elections. Voters rejected the initiative, I-1082, by a wide margin. The initiative was spearheaded by the Building Industry Association of Washington and endorsed by the National Federal of Independent Business. It would have created a task force on private competition to draw up legislation and make recommendations.</li>\r\n	<li>In Ohio, which also has a monopolistic state fund, there has also been interest in allowing some form of competition from private insurers. In November 2009 the Senate voted to create a task force to evaluate the current system, compare it with competitive systems in other states and review the options. At a hearing held in August 2010, the president of the Insurance Information Institute, Robert Hartwig, suggested that the state’s monopolistic system is out of keeping with economic reality. There is no other type of liability insurance in the United States where the state is the sole provider of coverage although states have had ample opportunity to create such a system. Ohio voters rejected a ballot initiative on privatization in 1981. Ohio has the largest monopolistic state fund in the nation. It would require a constitutional amendment to totally privatize Ohio’s system.</li>\r\n	<li>In July 1, 2008 West Virginia opened up its workers compensation business to any insurer that meets state requirements. Before, coverage was only available from the state-run mutual company. In readiness for the change over, 147 insurers filed rates; 23 were new to the state, according to the insurance department. The state was one of five with a so-called monopolist state fund, from which all employers, except those that are self-insured, must purchase their workers compensation coverage. The privatization process was phased in. A private mutual insurance company was created in June 2005. Nevada went through a similar change several years ago, enacting legislation to begin the workers compensation privatization process in 1999. It now has a mutual insurance company.</li>\r\n	<li>The move to privatize comes at a time when state funds are growing. According to a new Conning Research &amp; Consulting study, Workers Compensation State Funds: Evolution of a Competitive Force, state-backed workers compensation funds operate in 25 states and account for one-quarter ($11.3 billion in premiums) of the workers compensation market. While they generally have higher losses than private insurers (they are often the market of last resort, insuring high risk businesses that cannot find coverage in the private marketplace) these are offset by higher investment income and operating results comparable to private insurers, the study found. State funds also work closely with other government agencies, such as state occupational and health and safety associations, to reduce injuries.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Financial Results:</strong> In May 2011 the NCCI released its annual "State of the Line" workers compensation market analysis, showing that in the 2010 calendar year the workers compensation system produced a large underwriting loss, with a combined ratio of 115, compared with 110 for 2009, although as in 2009 three percentage points were due to a single insurer adding to its reserves. In 2010 the figure was $800 million, the year before $1 billion. Even at 112, this is a considerable deterioration from 2009. State funds fared even worse, reporting a combined ratio of 120 compared with several years of 111-115.</li>\r\n	<li>Premiums in 2010 were lower than in 2009, but the drop was less precipitous than in prior years, decreasing just 1.3 percent from 12 months earlier.</li>\r\n	<li>An analysis by the Insurance Information Institute shows that although unemployment and the resulting loss of payroll, the basis for workers compensation premiums, contributed to the sharp drop in premium over the past several years, aggressive pricing along with large deductible programs, and the use of captives and self insurance are responsible for a significant portion of this decline, which started as far back as 2006. Another depressing factor is the drop in interest rates. Low rates reduce the amount of investment income available to offset underwriting losses. According to A.M.Best, a 1 percent drop in yield on an insurer’s investment portfolio requires a 5.7 improvement in the workers compensation combined ratio.</li>\r\n	<li>The residual market share, as measured by premiums, fell again in 2010 but there are signs that it could be creeping up: premiums for the residual market were slightly higher in the first quarter 2011 than in the same quarter 2010. Residual market premiums totaled $400 million, down from $700 million in 2008, representing a 5 percent market share, about the same as in 2009. Among businesses insured in the residual market, large employers are most likely to be leaving.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Obesity and Workplace Injury Costs:</strong> Initial findings from an NCCI study on the cost of claims filed by workers who are obese found that their claim costs were significantly higher than those filed by nonobese workers. The findings are similar to a 2007 study of employees at Duke University. There, workers who were morbidly obese (those with body mass index (BMI) of 40 and above) filed 45 percent more claims, missed eight times the number of workdays and experienced medical costs that were more than five times higher than those of nonobese workers. Likewise, workers who were overweight (those with a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9) filed 9 percent more claims, with costs that were 1.5 times as high as people with so-called normal weights (a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9) and missed up to 3.5 times as many workdays. The NCCI study results, which will help underwriters more accurately assess how obesity is pushing up workers compensation claim costs, was released in December 2010.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Workplace Deaths and Injuries:</strong> Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data show that 4,340 workers were killed on the job in 2009, compared with 5,071 workplace fatalities in 2008 and 5,657 in 2007, with the greatest decrease in transportation-related deaths. The death rate for 2009 per 100,000 workers was 3.3 compared with 3.7 in 2008, a significant drop that many experts attribute to the poor economy. Fewer people were working last year in jobs where many of the fatalities typically occur such as construction.</li>\r\n	<li>Workplace injury rates are now at their lowest level since the BLS began tracking information in the 1970s, according to the agency. BLS data show rates for private workplace injuries and illnesses dropped 7 percent from 2007 to 2008, the latest available data. In 2008 the rate decreased to 113 per 10,000 full-time workers and the number of cases dropped by 80,730. Some 1.1 million cases requiring days off work or restricted duties were reported in private industry workplaces, down from 1.2 million in 2007.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the NCCI on the number of claims (frequency), published in the summer of 2009, found that claims frequency had dropped 4.0 percent in 2008, compared with 2.6 percent in 2007. The number of claims overall has been falling since the 1990s but the size of the decrease has been fluctuating from year to year. In 2005 and 2003 the drop was close to 7 percent but in 1999 it was 2.3 percent and there were even slight increases in 1994 and 1997. Almost every employment category the NCCI examined has experienced declines.</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of claims (severity) has continued to grow, however, particularly for medical care, with an estimated jump of 6.0 percent for workers compensation medical care costs, compared with an estimated 3.7 percent for the medical care consumer price index. As part of the review, the NCCI looked at changes in permanent total claims, the costliest 1 percent of lost-time claims, which have risen significantly over the past few years, driven primarily by injuries to people under 50.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the Texas Department of Insurance Research and Evaluation of workers injured between 2004 and 2007 showed that workers are returning to work faster. For 2007 some 76 percent of workers returned to work within six months of the injury, compared with 72 percent in 2003. After 18 months, 91 percent had returned in 2007, compared with 85 percent in 2003.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>', 'Workers Compensation', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'workers-compensation', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:36:54', '2014-03-29 10:36:54', '', 36, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=171', 2, 'page', '', 0);

Starting in the 1970''s, surety bonds began to be used to guarantee the principal and interest payments on municipal obligations. This made the bonds more attractive to investors and at the same time benefited bond issuers because having the insurance lowered their borrowing costs. Initially, financial guaranty insurance was considered a special category of surety. It became a separate line of insurance in 1986.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinancial guaranty insurers are specialized, highly capitalized companies that traditionally have had the highest rating. The insurer’s high rating attaches to the bonds, lowering the riskiness of the bonds to investors. With their credit rating thus enhanced, municipalities can issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate, enabling them to borrow more for the same outlay of funds.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOver the years financial guaranty insurers have expanded their reach beyond municipal bonds and now insure a wide array of products, including mortgage-backed securities, pools of credit default swaps and other structured transactions. Recent problems in the credit markets have taken a toll on financial guaranty insurers, as they confront heavy losses related to these structured instruments.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Bonds', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'bonds', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:52:10', '2014-03-29 10:52:10', '', 36, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=179', 6, 'page', '', 0);

The coverage focuses on alleged failure to perform on the part of, financial loss caused by, and error or omission in the service or product sold by the policyholder. These are potential causes for legal action that would not be covered by a more general liability insurance policy which addresses more direct forms of harm.

Yet a recent nationwide study found that the number of households covered by individual life insurance has decreased, according to the <a href="http://www.iii.org/">Insurance Information Institute</a> (I.I.I.).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“You need life insurance coverage if you are the primary wage earner in a household, or if someone relies on you financially,” said Michael Barry, the I.I.I.’s vice president, Media Relations. “And the premium payments are reasonable when you consider the level of protection a policyholder’s beneficiaries receive.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href="http://www.limra.com/">LIMRA</a>, its upcoming 2010 <em>Trends in Life Insurance Ownership</em> study indicates that 11 million U.S. households with children under the age of 18 have no individual life insurance policyholder in the family. LIMRA says in the same report that individual life insurance coverage in the U.S. has hit a 50-year low.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLIMRA does note that one in four U.S. households in 2010 had a wage earner who was covered under a group life insurance policy, often secured through their employer. The economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, has had an impact in this area, too, because these wage earners often lose their only life insurance coverage if they become unemployed or have their work hours reduced.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an individual or group life insurance policy, a deceased wage earner’s spouse and school-age beneficiaries may need to rely largely on Social Security survivor benefits as their main source of income.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThose in the market for life insurance need to know there are two major types of policies: Term and Permanent.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li><strong>Term insurance</strong> is a form of life insurance that pays out only if the death occurs during the “term” of the policy, which is usually anywhere from one to 30 years. The premium rates for term policies are comparatively less expensive than they used to be, as Americans as a whole live longer and healthier lives.If you are buying a short-term life insurance policy (under 10 years), look for renewal guarantees. A renewal guarantee gives you the right to start a new term after the current one ends. You will pay a higher premium based on your current age, but will not be required to undergo a new health exam nor submit any other “evidence of insurability.” Without the renewal guarantee, you would have to start from scratch when applying for a policy and, if your health has deteriorated in the interim, you might end up paying significantly higher premiums or not getting coverage at all.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li><strong>Permanent</strong> <strong>life insurance</strong> encompasses several subcategories, including traditional whole life, universal life, variable life and variable universal life. Unlike term life, permanent policies remain in force as long as the premium is paid, and some policies accumulate a cash value. The premium rates for whole life policies have generally remained stable in recent years.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“Look for a policy that meets your needs,” said Barry. “There are ways to save money when buying life insurance but they don''t always involve paying a lower premium immediately.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe I.I.I. offers the following tips to maximize your life insurance dollars when buying a policy:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BEFORE YOU BUY</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>\r\n<ol start="1" type="1">\r\n	<li><strong>Assess the quality of the company</strong>\r\nAn insurance policy is only as good as the company that backs it. You should make sure that the company that issues your policy will be around to service it and eventually to pay the death claim. There are several ratings agencies that assess insurance companies on their ability to remain financially sound over the long term. A rating represents an independent assessment of the insurer''s ability to pay its claims on time and meet all its other financial obligations; reviewing these ratings can help you find a financially strong company. It is a good idea to look at least two of the four leading ratings agencies: A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody''s and Standard &amp; Poor''s. The I.I.I. also offers guidance on selecting the right life insurance company: <a href="http://www.iii.org/individuals/life/buying/pickacompany">How do I pick a life insurance company?</a></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Look into group insurance</strong>\r\nConsider participating in your employer-sponsored group life insurance program, even if you have to contribute to it financially. Policies available through the workplace often have the advantage of group rates and limited medical underwriting. Employers may subsidize their group insurance costs as well. It is worth exploring what is available to you through the workplace and comparing it to coverage available to you as an individual. In comparing group to individual life insurance, remember that if you have over $50,000 of group life insurance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines how much it costs to provide the amount over $50,000 and imputes taxable income for that cost. If you are in your fifties or older, or are buying larger amounts of life insurance coverage, it is worth taking these IRS rules into consideration.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Buy when you are healthy</strong>\r\nFind out which rate class you will be grouped into and, if necessary, consider making some lifestyle changes—not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly—to qualify for a more favorable rate class. Buy when you are younger and healthier, if possible. Older people and those not in the best of health pay steeply higher rates for life insurance, so buy as early as you can once you have dependents.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>', 'Life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'life', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:04:26', '2014-03-29 11:04:26', '', 24, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=183', 4, 'page', '', 0);

Coverage is usually about $1,000 or 10 percent of the home''s property value and generally includes the boat, motor and trailer combined. Liability coverage is typically not included–but it can be added as an endorsement to a homeowners policy. Check with your insurance representative to find out if your boat is covered and what the limits are.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLarger and faster boats such as yachts, and personal watercraft such as jet skis and wave runners require a separate boat insurance policy. The size, type and value of the craft and the water in which you use it factor into how much you will pay for insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor physical loss or damage, coverage includes the hull, machinery, fittings, furnishings and permanently attached equipment as part of either an actual cash value policy or on an agreed amount value basis.

You want it to fit your needs and lifestyle, but at the same time be within your budget. Although most states require you to carry a minimum amount of liability coverage, other types of coverage are usually optional. Always ask your insurance agent or company representative which laws apply in your state.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn order to find out what coverage is best for you, it is important to understand all the options available.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>LIABILITY COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLiability insurance covers bodily injury and property damage that you may cause to other people involved in an accident. It doesn''t cover you or your motorcycle. Find out if your coverage includes Guest Passenger Liability, which provides protection in the event that a passenger is injured on the motorcycle. Whether or not this is included depends on the laws of your state and the company issuing the policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>COLLISION COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCollision insurance covers damage to your motorcycle if you are involved in an accident. Your insurance company pays for damages, minus your deductible, caused when you collide with another vehicle or object. Collision insurance usually covers the book value of the motorcycle before the loss occurred.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nComprehensive coverage pays for damages caused by an event other than a collision, such as fire, theft or vandalism. However, just like collision coverage, your insurance company will pay for damages, minus your deductible, and will cover only the book value of the motorcycle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep in mind most comprehensive and collision coverages will only cover the factory standard parts on your motorcycle. If you decide to add on any optional accessories such as chrome parts, a custom paint job, trailers or sidecars, you should look into obtaining additional or optional equipment coverage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUninsured/underinsured Motorist Coverage covers damages to you and your property caused by another driver who either doesn''t have insurance (uninsured) or doesn''t have adequate insurance (underinsured) to cover your damages.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis coverage typically pays for medical treatment, lost wages and other damages. If your uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage includes property damage, then your motorcycle would also be covered under the same circumstances. Check with your insurance professional to see if property damage is included or needs to be purchased separately.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>TIPS FOR THE COST-CONSCIOUS RIDER</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany factors can play a role in determining what your insurance costs will be such as your age, your driving record, where you live and the type of motorcycle you own, or being a graduate of a rider-training course.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Many companies offer discounts from 10 to 15 percent on motorcycle insurance for graduates of training courses, such as the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) rider course. Riders under the age of 25, usually considered a higher risk, may see some savings by taking this course. It’s also a good idea for cyclists who have already had accidents.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining a good driving record with no violations will also help reduce your premiums.</li>\r\n	<li>In many northern states, riders may save money by buying a "lay-up" policy. With a lay-up policy, all coverage except comprehensive is suspended during winter months.</li>\r\n	<li>Find out what discounts your insurance representative offers. Multibike discounts for those insuring more than one bike, organization discounts, if you’re a member of a motorcycle association, and mature rider discounts for experienced riders, are just a few possibilities. Discounts can range anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent, depending on the company and your state. Availability and qualifications for discounts vary from company to company and state to state.</li>\r\n	<li>Keep in mind that the type, style (such as a sports bike vs. a cruiser) and age of the motorcycle, as well as the number of miles you drive a year and where you store your bike may also affect how much you pay for your premium.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'Motorcycle', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'motorcycle', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:22:52', '2014-03-29 11:22:52', '', 24, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=189', 8, 'page', '', 0);

You make all decisions about how to spend the money without relying on a third party or a health insurer. You also decide what types of investments to make with the money in the account in order to make it grow. However, if you sign up for an HSA, you are generally required to buy a High Deductible Health Plan as well.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'HSA', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'hsa', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:08:47', '2014-03-29 11:08:47', '', 185, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=193', 2, 'page', '', 0);

There are several different types of individual, family, or group dental insurance plans divided into three primary categories: Indemnity (or sometimes called: true dental insurance) which allows you to see any dentist you want who accepts insurance, Preferred Provider Network dental plans (PPO; briefly discussed below), and Dental Health Managed Organizations (DHMO) in which you are assigned to an in-network dentist or in-network dental office and must stay within that network to receive your dental benefits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGenerally dental offices have a fee schedule, or a list of prices for the dental services or procedures they offer. Dental insurance companies have similar fee schedules which are generally based on <a title="Usual, customary and reasonable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usual,_customary_and_reasonable">Usual and Customary dental services</a>, an average of fees in your area. When a dentist signs a contract with a dental insurance company that provider agrees to match the insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced cost for services, this is considered an In-Network Provider or Participating Provider network (PPO). Depending on your specific plan, if you seek an Out-of-Network or Non-Participating Provider, any difference of fees will become the financial responsibility of the patient unless otherwise specified in your dental policy. Some dental insurance plans may have <a title="Waiting period" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_period">waiting period</a> restrictions. This is a period of time before certain benefits will be covered, and is often set in place when you are a new enrollee or seek out an independent plan outside of an employer or group.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDental insurance plans may have an annual maximum benefit limit and after that maximum benefit additional treatments become the patient''s responsibility. Each year that annual maximum is reissued. The reissued date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year, or date of enrollment based on your specific plan. <a title="Orthodontics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics">Orthodontics</a> usually has a separate limit. Some plans may have an annual <a title="Deductible" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible">deductible</a> depending on the treatment rendered. After the deductible is met, the remaining fee is then paid at its specified percentage or fee schedule.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDental insurance companies set services or procedures into categories and refer to them with American Dental Association (ADA) codes. As an example, Preventative and Diagnostic procedures often include exams, <a title="Dental radiography" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_radiography">x-rays</a>, and <a title="Dental cleaning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_cleaning">basic cleanings</a> or <a title="Preventive medicine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine#Prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a>. Basic procedures often include <a title="Dental restoration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration">fillings</a>, <a title="Periodontology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology">periodontics</a>, <a title="Endodontics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics">endodontics</a>, and <a title="Oral surgery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_surgery">oral surgery</a>. Major procedures often are <a title="Crown (dentistry)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_%28dentistry%29">crowns</a>, <a title="Dentures" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures">dentures</a>, and <a title="Dental implant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant">implants</a>. Procedures such as periodontics, endodontics, and oral surgery may fall into the Major category depending on your specific plan with specific fee schedules and co-payments. Many dental insurance plans offer free semi-annual preventative treatment. Fillings, crowns, implants and dentures may have various limitations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe enrollment process varies but often members are assigned an identification or policy number. When dental treatment is rendered a claim for services is filed with the dental insurance company. Eligibility of Benefits, or EOB, statements are most often then sent with payment to both the provider of service and the plan policy holder.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUpon enrollment, be informed through the enrollee benefit packet regarding coverage and contact a dental provider and/or dental insurance company with additional questions about specific dental benefits.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Dental', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'dental', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:10:51', '2014-03-29 11:10:51', '', 185, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=197', 4, 'page', '', 0);

In other words, people belong to the group not because they possess some high-risk factor which makes them more apt to purchase insurance (thus increasing adverse selection); instead they are in the group for reasons unrelated to insurance, such as all working for a particular employer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA feature which is sometimes common in group insurance is that the premium cost on an individual basis may not be risk-based. Instead it is the same amount for all the insured persons in the group. So, for example, in the United States, often all employees of an employer receiving health insurance coverage pay the same premium amount for the same coverage regardless of their age or other factors. In contrast, under private individual health insurance coverage in the U.S., different insured persons will pay different premium amounts for the same coverage based on their age, location, pre-existing conditions, etc.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature is that under group coverage, a member of the group is generally eligible to purchase or renew coverage while he or she is a member of the group subject to certain conditions. Again, using U.S. health coverage as an example, under group insurance a person will normally remain covered as long as he or she continues to work for a certain employer and pays the required insurance premiums, whereas under individual coverage, the insurance company often has the right to non-renew a person''s individual health insurance policy when the policy is up for renewal, which it may do if the person''s risk profile changes (though some states limit the insurance company''s ability to non-renew after the person has been under individual coverage with a given company for a certain number of years).\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Group Insurance', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'group-insurance', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:15:21', '2014-03-29 11:15:21', '', 185, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/?page_id=203', 7, 'page', '', 0);

You will be paying insurance on your home for as long as you own it, so you should factor the cost of insurance into the home-buying process. You don’t want to find out that your dream home is more expensive to insure than you thought—after you own it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBEFORE YOU START LOOKING FOR A HOME\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThinking through all the costs associated with buying a home will make the process run more smoothly, and it may also save you money. It is important to:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Check Your Credit Rating</em></strong>\n\nA good credit history helps you in many ways. Good credit makes it easier to get a mortgage at a competitive rate, and it may also qualify you for a good credit discount on your insurance. Make sure you know your credit rating before you apply for a mortgage. Get a copy of one or all of your credit reports. Make sure they are accurate and report any mistakes immediately. If your credit is not as good as it could be take steps now to improve it. The I.I.I. has information on <a href="http://www2.iii.org/individuals/credit">credit and insurance</a> to help you with this process\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Protect Yourself with a Renters Insurance Policy</em></strong>\n\nIf you are currently renting a house or apartment, protect yourself financially with a <a href="http://www.iii.org/articles/can-i-get-insurance-if-i-rent-my-home.html">renters insurance policy</a>. This provides insurance protection in the event a fire, hurricane or other insured disaster damages or destroys your personal possessions. It also covers the cost of additional living expenses if something happens to make your rental home or apartment unlivable. Additionally, renters insurance gives you liability protection if someone is injured in your home and decides to sue you. Disasters happen, and it would be unfortunate to have to use the down payment you saved to buy your new home to pay for losses that could have been covered by renters insurance. Furthermore, having a renters insurance policy provides a useful insurance history to your prospective homeowners insurer when you go to buy your first home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWHILE HOUSE HUNTING\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs you search for your new home, remember that the physical characteristics of the house—its size, location, construction and overall condition—can affect the cost, choice and availability of home insurance. Following are some factors to consider when shopping for a home:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Quality and Location of the Fire Department</em></strong>\n\nHouses that are located near highly-rated, permanently staffed fire departments usually cost less to insure. This also holds true for homes that have a hydrant nearby. An important underwriting criterion for insurance companies is a community’s investment in fire protection, which includes trained firefighters, proper equipment and adequate supplies of water.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Proximity to the Coastline</em></strong>\n\nHouses located on or near the coast will generally cost more to insure than those further inland. There will also likely be a <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm">hurricane or windstorm deductible</a>. This is a percentage deductible based on the cost to rebuilding a home, rather than a flat dollar amount. With a homeowners policy that has a $500 standard deductible, for example, the policyholder pays the first $500 of the claim before insurance kicks in. However, as percentage deductibles are based on the home’s insured value, if a house is insured for $100,000 and has a 2 percent deductible, the first $2,000 of a claim is paid out of the policyholder’s pocket.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are two kinds of wind damage deductibles: hurricane deductibles, which apply to damage solely from hurricanes; and windstorm or wind/hail deductibles, which apply to any kind of wind damage. Percentage deductibles typically vary by state and range from 1 percent to 5 percent of a home’s insured value. These come into effect if certain triggers occur—a deductible triggering event can be, for instance, an official National Weather Service declaration that a storm is generating hurricane-strength winds (i.e., 74 miles per hour, or more) in your community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn coastal areas with high wind risk, some homeowners may select higher hurricane deductibles to lower their insurance premiums, but that means they pay more if their home is damaged. In some coastal communities, private homeowners insurance coverage may not be readily available. Instead, you may need to purchase insurance through a state-run insurance program, which can provide less coverage, and in some cases be more costly, than private insurance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Age of the Home</em></strong>\n\nA stately, older home can be quite beautiful, but ornate features such as plaster walls, ceiling molding and wooden floors may be costly to replace and raise the cost of insurance. Plumbing and electrical systems can become unsafe with age and lack of maintenance. So, older homes may cost more to insure. If you are considering buying an older home find out how much it will cost to update these features and factor it into the cost of ownership.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Condition of the Roof</em></strong>\n\nAsk about the condition of the roof. A new roof matters to insurers and keeps you and your family safer. Depending on the type of roof and whether or not you use fire and/or hail resistant materials, you may even qualify for a discount. Talk to your insurer about qualifying discounts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Is the Home Well-Built and Up to Code?</em></strong>\n\nFind out whether the house has been updated to comply with current building codes. Homes built by careful craftsmen and those built to meet modern engineering-based building codes are likely to better withstand natural disasters. Consider hiring a licensed home inspector who is knowledgeable about the latest building codes to inspect the property before you sign a mortgage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Risk of Flooding</em></strong>\n\nDamage from flooding is NOT covered by standard home insurance policies. If you are buying a home in an area at risk from flooding, you will need to purchase separate insurance. Insurance for flooding is available from the federal government’s <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers. People often underestimate the risk of flooding. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the NFIP. More important is that 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses for flooding are for damage in areas not officially designated as special flood hazard areas. If you are not in a high-risk flood zone, NFIP coverage is available at a lower premium.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>History of Earthquakes </em></strong><strong>\n</strong>\n\nWhile earthquakes are most frequently associated with California, they have occurred in 39 states and, like flooding, are not covered under standard home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is available from private insurers as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, and in California from the <a href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/">California Earthquake Authority</a>, a privately funded, publicly managed organization.  The cost of earthquake insurance differs widely by location, insurer and the type of structure being covered. Generally, older buildings cost more to insure than new ones. Wood frame structures may benefit from lower rates than brick buildings because they tend to withstand quake stresses better. Regions are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 for likelihood of quakes, and this difference is reflected in insurance rates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Swimming Pool or Other Special Feature</em></strong><strong>\n</strong>\n\nIf the house has a swimming pool, hot tub or other special feature, you will likely need more liability insurance. You may also want to consider purchasing an excess or umbrella liability policy to provide added protection in the event someone gets injured on your property and decides to sue you.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID ON THE HOME</h3>\n<strong><em>Check the Loss History Report</em></strong>\n\nAsk the current owner of the house for a copy of the insurance loss history report, such as a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.) report from ChoicePoint or an A-PLUS report from ISO, a leading source of information about property/casualty insurance. This is a record of insurance claims on the house that can provide answers to two questions that any savvy homebuyer should ask:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul type="square">\n	<li>Have there been any past problems in the home?</li>\n	<li>If damage has occurred, was it properly repaired?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nNote that prior claims are not a barrier to getting insurance. In fact, sometimes a recent claim can have positive ramifications. If, for example, a roof was damaged by a wind storm and replaced by a new one, this would make the house more desirable to an insurance company. If there have been no claims within five years, there will be no loss history report on the home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'Home', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '34-autosave-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 09:47:17', '2014-03-29 09:47:17', '', 34, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/34-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ask your insurance professional if the house will qualify for insurance, and get an estimate of the premium. The sooner you act, the smoother the process will be. Don&rsquo;t be shy about asking for estimates on more than one house. Insurance is an important consideration when purchasing a home.

Good credit makes it easier to get a mortgage at a competitive rate, and it may also qualify you for a good credit discount on your insurance. Make sure you know your credit rating before you apply for a mortgage. Get a copy of one or all of your credit reports. Make sure they are accurate and report any mistakes immediately. If your credit is not as good as it could be take steps now to improve it. The I.I.I. has information on <a href="http://www2.iii.org/individuals/credit">credit and insurance</a> to help you with this process\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Protect Yourself with a Renters Insurance Policy</em></strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are currently renting a house or apartment, protect yourself financially with a <a href="http://www.iii.org/articles/can-i-get-insurance-if-i-rent-my-home.html">renters insurance policy</a>. This provides insurance protection in the event a fire, hurricane or other insured disaster damages or destroys your personal possessions. It also covers the cost of additional living expenses if something happens to make your rental home or apartment unlivable. Additionally, renters insurance gives you liability protection if someone is injured in your home and decides to sue you. Disasters happen, and it would be unfortunate to have to use the down payment you saved to buy your new home to pay for losses that could have been covered by renters insurance. Furthermore, having a renters insurance policy provides a useful insurance history to your prospective homeowners insurer when you go to buy your first home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWHILE HOUSE HUNTING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs you search for your new home, remember that the physical characteristics of the house—its size, location, construction and overall condition—can affect the cost, choice and availability of home insurance. Following are some factors to consider when shopping for a home:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Quality and Location of the Fire Department</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses that are located near highly-rated, permanently staffed fire departments usually cost less to insure. This also holds true for homes that have a hydrant nearby. An important underwriting criterion for insurance companies is a community’s investment in fire protection, which includes trained firefighters, proper equipment and adequate supplies of water.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Proximity to the Coastline</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses located on or near the coast will generally cost more to insure than those further inland. There will also likely be a <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm">hurricane or windstorm deductible</a>. This is a percentage deductible based on the cost to rebuilding a home, rather than a flat dollar amount. With a homeowners policy that has a $500 standard deductible, for example, the policyholder pays the first $500 of the claim before insurance kicks in. However, as percentage deductibles are based on the home’s insured value, if a house is insured for $100,000 and has a 2 percent deductible, the first $2,000 of a claim is paid out of the policyholder’s pocket.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wind damage deductibles: hurricane deductibles, which apply to damage solely from hurricanes; and windstorm or wind/hail deductibles, which apply to any kind of wind damage. Percentage deductibles typically vary by state and range from 1 percent to 5 percent of a home’s insured value. These come into effect if certain triggers occur—a deductible triggering event can be, for instance, an official National Weather Service declaration that a storm is generating hurricane-strength winds (i.e., 74 miles per hour, or more) in your community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn coastal areas with high wind risk, some homeowners may select higher hurricane deductibles to lower their insurance premiums, but that means they pay more if their home is damaged. In some coastal communities, private homeowners insurance coverage may not be readily available. Instead, you may need to purchase insurance through a state-run insurance program, which can provide less coverage, and in some cases be more costly, than private insurance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Age of the Home</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA stately, older home can be quite beautiful, but ornate features such as plaster walls, ceiling molding and wooden floors may be costly to replace and raise the cost of insurance. Plumbing and electrical systems can become unsafe with age and lack of maintenance. So, older homes may cost more to insure. If you are considering buying an older home find out how much it will cost to update these features and factor it into the cost of ownership.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Condition of the Roof</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk about the condition of the roof. A new roof matters to insurers and keeps you and your family safer. Depending on the type of roof and whether or not you use fire and/or hail resistant materials, you may even qualify for a discount. Talk to your insurer about qualifying discounts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Is the Home Well-Built and Up to Code?</em></strong>\r\n\r\nFind out whether the house has been updated to comply with current building codes. Homes built by careful craftsmen and those built to meet modern engineering-based building codes are likely to better withstand natural disasters. Consider hiring a licensed home inspector who is knowledgeable about the latest building codes to inspect the property before you sign a mortgage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Risk of Flooding</em></strong>\r\n\r\nDamage from flooding is NOT covered by standard home insurance policies. If you are buying a home in an area at risk from flooding, you will need to purchase separate insurance. Insurance for flooding is available from the federal government’s <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers. People often underestimate the risk of flooding. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the NFIP. More important is that 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses for flooding are for damage in areas not officially designated as special flood hazard areas. If you are not in a high-risk flood zone, NFIP coverage is available at a lower premium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>History of Earthquakes </em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile earthquakes are most frequently associated with California, they have occurred in 39 states and, like flooding, are not covered under standard home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is available from private insurers as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, and in California from the <a href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/">California Earthquake Authority</a>, a privately funded, publicly managed organization.  The cost of earthquake insurance differs widely by location, insurer and the type of structure being covered. Generally, older buildings cost more to insure than new ones. Wood frame structures may benefit from lower rates than brick buildings because they tend to withstand quake stresses better. Regions are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 for likelihood of quakes, and this difference is reflected in insurance rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Swimming Pool or Other Special Feature</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the house has a swimming pool, hot tub or other special feature, you will likely need more liability insurance. You may also want to consider purchasing an excess or umbrella liability policy to provide added protection in the event someone gets injured on your property and decides to sue you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID ON THE HOME</h3>\r\n<strong><em>Check the Loss History Report</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk the current owner of the house for a copy of the insurance loss history report, such as a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.) report from ChoicePoint or an A-PLUS report from ISO, a leading source of information about property/casualty insurance. This is a record of insurance claims on the house that can provide answers to two questions that any savvy homebuyer should ask:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Have there been any past problems in the home?</li>\r\n	<li>If damage has occurred, was it properly repaired?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote that prior claims are not a barrier to getting insurance. In fact, sometimes a recent claim can have positive ramifications. If, for example, a roof was damaged by a wind storm and replaced by a new one, this would make the house more desirable to an insurance company. If there have been no claims within five years, there will be no loss history report on the home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Get the House Inspected</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nA thorough inspection of the home is very important. The inspector should:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>check the general condition of the home;</li>\r\n	<li>look for water damage, termites and other types of infestation;</li>\r\n	<li>pay special attention to the electrical system, septic tank and water heater;</li>\r\n	<li>show you where potential problems might develop;</li>\r\n	<li>double-check that past problems have been repaired;</li>\r\n	<li>suggest upgrades or replacements that may be needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>If the inspector raises questions, your insurance company will as well. And, be sure to find out if there is an underground oil storage tank, as many insurers will not provide policies for homes that have one.</div>\r\n<div><strong><em>Determine How Much It Will Cost to Maintain the House</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>Routine maintenance is your responsibility as a homeowner. Losses caused by failing to properly care for your home are not covered by standard homeowners insurance policies. The yearly cost of taking care of your house is another factor to be included in the overall price of owning the home.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><strong><em>Call Your Insurance Representative</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong></div>\r\n<div>Don’t wait until the last minute to think about insurance.

Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost</strong>\r\nThis policy offers the highest level of protection. A guaranteed replacement cost policy pays whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster—even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally won’t cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help pay for these additional costs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome insurance companies offer an extended, rather than a guaranteed, replacement cost policy. An extended policy pays a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild the home. Generally, it is 20 to 25 percent more than the limit of the policy. For example, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage. Guaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but they offer the best financial protection against disasters for a home. These coverages, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies. Replacement cost coverage is available for the structure of the home, but only actual cash value coverage is available for possessions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Home Owners', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '38-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 09:58:29', '2014-03-29 09:58:29', '', 38, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/38-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\n	<li>Liability</li>\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Personal Possessions</h2>\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Liability</h2>\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Additional Living Expenses</h2>\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\n\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy. The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from. Insurers who offer homeowners insurance generally also sell renters insurance. In fact, a renters insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy are almost identical. The main difference is that a renters policy doesn’t include coverage for the building, since the landlord owns that.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Comparison Shop</h2>\nPrices vary from company to company, so it pays to shop around. Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet. Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\n\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\n\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions.  Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks. More discounts might be available depending on your age or whether or not you smoke.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Filing a Renters Insurance Claim</h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>REPORT ANY CRIME TO THE POLICE</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police. Get a police report and the names of all law enforcement officers with whom you speak.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 class="act">CALL (713) 270-0073 TO GET ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS:</h3>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n	<li>How long to I have to file a claim?

Don’t throw out damaged items until a claims adjuster has visited\nyour home. You should also consider photographing or videotaping the damage. Prepare a list of damaged or stolen items for your adjuster along with copies of receipts.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>IF YOU NEED TO RELOCATE, KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS</h3>\nIf your home is severely damaged and you need to find other accommodations while repairs are being\nmade, keep records of all expenses.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 class="act">GET CLAIM FORMS</h3>\nOnce you’ve notified your insurer of your claim, the company is required to send the necessary claim forms to you by the end of a set time period. (The time period varies from state to state.) Return the properly filled out forms as soon as possible to speed up your claim.\n<strong>If you feel your insurer hasn’t given you satisfactory service</strong>, you should talk to the agent or company representative who sold you your policy or your insurer’s claims manager. If you’re still unhappy, contact your state insurance department or local consumer protection office to discuss what you can do.\nState insurance department telephone numbers and Web site addresses can be found <a href="http://www2.iii.org/stateorganizations/">here</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 class="act">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Q. Is my bicycle covered by renters insurance?</strong>\nA. Your bicycle and other recreational or sports equipment are covered. There are also special policies you can buy for very expensive sports equipment.\n<strong>Q. Is my car covered?</strong>\nA. Vehicles aren’t covered by renters insurance.  You need to get a separate auto insurance policy to drive legally and protect your car, van or motorcycle.\n<strong>Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents’ insurance?</strong>\nA. If you’re a college student living in a dorm and are still part of your parents’ household, their homeowners or renters insurance provides coverage. If you live off campus, you’ll probably need your own renters policy. Policies can vary, so speak to your insurer about this.\n<strong>Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roommate or domestic partner?</strong>\nA. Regulations differ from state to state, and policies might also differ from company to company. Find out\nwhat regulations apply where you live. Some insurance companies allow unmarried couples who have been living together to buy joint coverage. But a domestic partner is usually not automatically insured, like a husband or wife, under the partner’s policy. He or she must be specifically named.\n<strong>Q. What happens if something I have rented or borrowed is stolen?</strong>\nA. Items that are “in your possession” are covered under a standard renters policy, whether they are things that you’ve bought, received as gifts or borrowed.\n<strong>Q. Is my property covered away from home?</strong>\nA. Yes, most renters polices include what is called Off-premises coverage.  This means that belongings that are outside of your home are also covered against the same disasters listed in your policy. For example, property stolen from your car would be covered. However, there are generally dollar limits on the amount you can be reimbursed. For example, if you have $25,000 worth of personal possessions insurance, you may be covered for up to $2,500, or 10 percent of the total.\n<strong>Q. Are my valuables covered by my renters insurance policy?</strong>\nA. In general you are covered for up to $1,500 for jewelry or other expensive items that are destroyed or lost to fire, windstorms, theft or other perils that are listed in your policy.  If your valuables are worth more than that, you should consider purchasing a “floater,” also called an “endorsement,” to increase the amount of coverage.\n<strong></strong>\n\n<strong>\nQ. How can I protect my house or apartment against a flood or earthquake?</strong>\nA. Renters insurance does not cover floods or earthquakes. Flood coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program (888) 379-9531, www.floodsmart.gov ) and from a few private insurers. You can get this coverage, however, from the same agent or company representative who sold you the renters insurance policy.

The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from. Insurers who offer homeowners insurance generally also sell renters insurance. In fact, a renters insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy are almost identical. The main difference is that a renters policy doesn’t include coverage for the building, since the landlord owns that.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Comparison Shop</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nPrices vary from company to company, so it pays to shop around. Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet. Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions.  Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks. More discounts might be available depending on your age or whether or not you smoke.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Filing a Renters Insurance Claim</h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>REPORT ANY CRIME TO THE POLICE</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police.

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\r\n\r\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\r\n\r\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\r\n	<li>Liability</li>\r\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Personal Possessions</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\r\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\r\n\r\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\r\n<h2>Liability</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\r\n\r\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\r\n\r\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\r\n<h2>Additional Living Expenses</h2>\r\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\r\n<h2>There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy.

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\r\n	<li>Liability</li>\r\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Personal Possessions</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\r\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\r\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\r\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Liability</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\r\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\r\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Additional Living Expenses</h2>\r\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy. The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\r\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from.

Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet. Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\r\n\r\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\r\n\r\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\r\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions.  Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\r\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\r\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks.

Is my bicycle covered by renters insurance?</strong>\r\nA. Your bicycle and other recreational or sports equipment are covered. There are also special policies you can buy for very expensive sports equipment.\r\n<strong>Q. Is my car covered?</strong>\r\nA. Vehicles aren’t covered by renters insurance.  You need to get a separate auto insurance policy to drive legally and protect your car, van or motorcycle.\r\n<strong>Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents’ insurance?</strong>\r\nA. If you’re a college student living in a dorm and are still part of your parents’ household, their homeowners or renters insurance provides coverage. If you live off campus, you’ll probably need your own renters policy. Policies can vary, so speak to your insurer about this.\r\n<strong>Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roommate or domestic partner?</strong>\r\nA. Regulations differ from state to state, and policies might also differ from company to company. Find out\r\nwhat regulations apply where you live. Some insurance companies allow unmarried couples who have been living together to buy joint coverage. But a domestic partner is usually not automatically insured, like a husband or wife, under the partner’s policy. He or she must be specifically named.\r\n<strong>Q. What happens if something I have rented or borrowed is stolen?</strong>\r\nA. Items that are “in your possession” are covered under a standard renters policy, whether they are things that you’ve bought, received as gifts or borrowed.\r\n<strong>Q. Is my property covered away from home?</strong>\r\nA. Yes, most renters polices include what is called Off-premises coverage.  This means that belongings that are outside of your home are also covered against the same disasters listed in your policy. For example, property stolen from your car would be covered. However, there are generally dollar limits on the amount you can be reimbursed. For example, if you have $25,000 worth of personal possessions insurance, you may be covered for up to $2,500, or 10 percent of the total.\r\n<strong>Q. Are my valuables covered by my renters insurance policy?</strong>\r\nA. In general you are covered for up to $1,500 for jewelry or other expensive items that are destroyed or lost to fire, windstorms, theft or other perils that are listed in your policy.  If your valuables are worth more than that, you should consider purchasing a “floater,” also called an “endorsement,” to increase the amount of coverage.\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nQ.

Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions. Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\r\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium. Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks. More discounts might be available depending on your age or whether or not you smoke.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 class="act">Filing a Renters Insurance Claim</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>REPORT ANY CRIME TO THE POLICE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police.

Is my bicycle covered by renters insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Your bicycle and other recreational or sports equipment are covered. There are also special policies you can buy for very expensive sports equipment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. Is my car covered?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Vehicles aren’t covered by renters insurance. You need to get a separate auto insurance policy to drive legally and protect your car, van or motorcycle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents’ insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. If you’re a college student living in a dorm and are still part of your parents’ household, their homeowners or renters insurance provides coverage. If you live off campus, you’ll probably need your own renters policy. Policies can vary, so speak to your insurer about this.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roommate or domestic partner?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Regulations differ from state to state, and policies might also differ from company to company. Find out\r\nwhat regulations apply where you live. Some insurance companies allow unmarried couples who have been living together to buy joint coverage. But a domestic partner is usually not automatically insured, like a husband or wife, under the partner’s policy. He or she must be specifically named.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. What happens if something I have rented or borrowed is stolen?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Items that are “in your possession” are covered under a standard renters policy, whether they are things that you’ve bought, received as gifts or borrowed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. Is my property covered away from home?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Yes, most renters polices include what is called Off-premises coverage. This means that belongings that are outside of your home are also covered against the same disasters listed in your policy. For example, property stolen from your car would be covered. However, there are generally dollar limits on the amount you can be reimbursed. For example, if you have $25,000 worth of personal possessions insurance, you may be covered for up to $2,500, or 10 percent of the total.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Q. Are my valuables covered by my renters insurance policy?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. In general you are covered for up to $1,500 for jewelry or other expensive items that are destroyed or lost to fire, windstorms, theft or other perils that are listed in your policy. If your valuables are worth more than that, you should consider purchasing a “floater,” also called an “endorsement,” to increase the amount of coverage.\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nQ. How can I protect my house or apartment against a flood or earthquake?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA. Renters insurance does not cover floods or earthquakes. Flood coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program (888) 379-9531, www.floodsmart.gov ) and from a few private insurers. You can get this coverage, however, from the same agent or company representative who sold you the renters insurance policy. Earthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an “endorsement” to your renters policy.', 'Renters', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '165-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:16:31', '2014-03-29 10:16:31', '', 165, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/165-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\r\n	<li>Liability</li>\r\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Personal Possessions</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\r\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Liability</h2>\r\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Additional Living Expenses</h2>\r\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy. The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\r\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from. Insurers who offer homeowners insurance generally also sell renters insurance. In fact, a renters insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy are almost identical. The main difference is that a renters policy doesn’t include coverage for the building, since the landlord owns that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Comparison Shop</h2>\r\nPrices vary from company to company, so it pays to shop around. Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet.

The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business.

You will be paying insurance on your home for as long as you own it, so you should factor the cost of insurance into the home-buying process. You don’t want to find out that your dream home is more expensive to insure than you thought—after you own it!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU START LOOKING FOR A HOME\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThinking through all the costs associated with buying a home will make the process run more smoothly, and it may also save you money. It is important to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Check Your Credit Rating</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA good credit history helps you in many ways. Good credit makes it easier to get a mortgage at a competitive rate, and it may also qualify you for a good credit discount on your insurance. Make sure you know your credit rating before you apply for a mortgage. Get a copy of one or all of your credit reports. Make sure they are accurate and report any mistakes immediately. If your credit is not as good as it could be take steps now to improve it. The I.I.I. has information on <a href="http://www2.iii.org/individuals/credit">credit and insurance</a> to help you with this process\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Protect Yourself with a Renters Insurance Policy</em></strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are currently renting a house or apartment, protect yourself financially with a <a href="http://www.iii.org/articles/can-i-get-insurance-if-i-rent-my-home.html">renters insurance policy</a>. This provides insurance protection in the event a fire, hurricane or other insured disaster damages or destroys your personal possessions. It also covers the cost of additional living expenses if something happens to make your rental home or apartment unlivable. Additionally, renters insurance gives you liability protection if someone is injured in your home and decides to sue you. Disasters happen, and it would be unfortunate to have to use the down payment you saved to buy your new home to pay for losses that could have been covered by renters insurance. Furthermore, having a renters insurance policy provides a useful insurance history to your prospective homeowners insurer when you go to buy your first home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWHILE HOUSE HUNTING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs you search for your new home, remember that the physical characteristics of the house—its size, location, construction and overall condition—can affect the cost, choice and availability of home insurance. Following are some factors to consider when shopping for a home:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Quality and Location of the Fire Department</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses that are located near highly-rated, permanently staffed fire departments usually cost less to insure. This also holds true for homes that have a hydrant nearby. An important underwriting criterion for insurance companies is a community’s investment in fire protection, which includes trained firefighters, proper equipment and adequate supplies of water.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Proximity to the Coastline</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses located on or near the coast will generally cost more to insure than those further inland. There will also likely be a <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm">hurricane or windstorm deductible</a>. This is a percentage deductible based on the cost to rebuilding a home, rather than a flat dollar amount. With a homeowners policy that has a $500 standard deductible, for example, the policyholder pays the first $500 of the claim before insurance kicks in. However, as percentage deductibles are based on the home’s insured value, if a house is insured for $100,000 and has a 2 percent deductible, the first $2,000 of a claim is paid out of the policyholder’s pocket.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wind damage deductibles: hurricane deductibles, which apply to damage solely from hurricanes; and windstorm or wind/hail deductibles, which apply to any kind of wind damage. Percentage deductibles typically vary by state and range from 1 percent to 5 percent of a home’s insured value. These come into effect if certain triggers occur—a deductible triggering event can be, for instance, an official National Weather Service declaration that a storm is generating hurricane-strength winds (i.e., 74 miles per hour, or more) in your community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn coastal areas with high wind risk, some homeowners may select higher hurricane deductibles to lower their insurance premiums, but that means they pay more if their home is damaged. In some coastal communities, private homeowners insurance coverage may not be readily available. Instead, you may need to purchase insurance through a state-run insurance program, which can provide less coverage, and in some cases be more costly, than private insurance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Age of the Home</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA stately, older home can be quite beautiful, but ornate features such as plaster walls, ceiling molding and wooden floors may be costly to replace and raise the cost of insurance. Plumbing and electrical systems can become unsafe with age and lack of maintenance. So, older homes may cost more to insure. If you are considering buying an older home find out how much it will cost to update these features and factor it into the cost of ownership.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Condition of the Roof</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk about the condition of the roof. A new roof matters to insurers and keeps you and your family safer. Depending on the type of roof and whether or not you use fire and/or hail resistant materials, you may even qualify for a discount. Talk to your insurer about qualifying discounts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Is the Home Well-Built and Up to Code?</em></strong>\r\n\r\nFind out whether the house has been updated to comply with current building codes. Homes built by careful craftsmen and those built to meet modern engineering-based building codes are likely to better withstand natural disasters. Consider hiring a licensed home inspector who is knowledgeable about the latest building codes to inspect the property before you sign a mortgage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Risk of Flooding</em></strong>\r\n\r\nDamage from flooding is NOT covered by standard home insurance policies. If you are buying a home in an area at risk from flooding, you will need to purchase separate insurance. Insurance for flooding is available from the federal government’s <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers. People often underestimate the risk of flooding. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the NFIP. More important is that 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses for flooding are for damage in areas not officially designated as special flood hazard areas. If you are not in a high-risk flood zone, NFIP coverage is available at a lower premium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>History of Earthquakes </em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile earthquakes are most frequently associated with California, they have occurred in 39 states and, like flooding, are not covered under standard home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is available from private insurers as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, and in California from the <a href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/">California Earthquake Authority</a>, a privately funded, publicly managed organization.  The cost of earthquake insurance differs widely by location, insurer and the type of structure being covered. Generally, older buildings cost more to insure than new ones. Wood frame structures may benefit from lower rates than brick buildings because they tend to withstand quake stresses better. Regions are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 for likelihood of quakes, and this difference is reflected in insurance rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Swimming Pool or Other Special Feature</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the house has a swimming pool, hot tub or other special feature, you will likely need more liability insurance. You may also want to consider purchasing an excess or umbrella liability policy to provide added protection in the event someone gets injured on your property and decides to sue you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID ON THE HOME</h3>\r\n<strong><em>Check the Loss History Report</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk the current owner of the house for a copy of the insurance loss history report, such as a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.) report from ChoicePoint or an A-PLUS report from ISO, a leading source of information about property/casualty insurance.

You will be paying insurance on your home for as long as you own it, so you should factor the cost of insurance into the home-buying process. You don’t want to find out that your dream home is more expensive to insure than you thought—after you own it!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU START LOOKING FOR A HOME\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThinking through all the costs associated with buying a home will make the process run more smoothly, and it may also save you money. It is important to:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Check Your Credit Rating</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA good credit history helps you in many ways. Good credit makes it easier to get a mortgage at a competitive rate, and it may also qualify you for a good credit discount on your insurance. Make sure you know your credit rating before you apply for a mortgage. Get a copy of one or all of your credit reports. Make sure they are accurate and report any mistakes immediately. If your credit is not as good as it could be take steps now to improve it. The I.I.I. has information on <a href="http://www2.iii.org/individuals/credit">credit and insurance</a> to help you with this process\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Protect Yourself with a Renters Insurance Policy</em></strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are currently renting a house or apartment, protect yourself financially with a <a href="http://www.iii.org/articles/can-i-get-insurance-if-i-rent-my-home.html">renters insurance policy</a>. This provides insurance protection in the event a fire, hurricane or other insured disaster damages or destroys your personal possessions. It also covers the cost of additional living expenses if something happens to make your rental home or apartment unlivable. Additionally, renters insurance gives you liability protection if someone is injured in your home and decides to sue you. Disasters happen, and it would be unfortunate to have to use the down payment you saved to buy your new home to pay for losses that could have been covered by renters insurance. Furthermore, having a renters insurance policy provides a useful insurance history to your prospective homeowners insurer when you go to buy your first home.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWHILE HOUSE HUNTING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs you search for your new home, remember that the physical characteristics of the house—its size, location, construction and overall condition—can affect the cost, choice and availability of home insurance. Following are some factors to consider when shopping for a home:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Quality and Location of the Fire Department</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses that are located near highly-rated, permanently staffed fire departments usually cost less to insure. This also holds true for homes that have a hydrant nearby. An important underwriting criterion for insurance companies is a community’s investment in fire protection, which includes trained firefighters, proper equipment and adequate supplies of water.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Proximity to the Coastline</em></strong>\r\n\r\nHouses located on or near the coast will generally cost more to insure than those further inland. There will also likely be a <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm">hurricane or windstorm deductible</a>. This is a percentage deductible based on the cost to rebuilding a home, rather than a flat dollar amount. With a homeowners policy that has a $500 standard deductible, for example, the policyholder pays the first $500 of the claim before insurance kicks in. However, as percentage deductibles are based on the home’s insured value, if a house is insured for $100,000 and has a 2 percent deductible, the first $2,000 of a claim is paid out of the policyholder’s pocket.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wind damage deductibles: hurricane deductibles, which apply to damage solely from hurricanes; and windstorm or wind/hail deductibles, which apply to any kind of wind damage. Percentage deductibles typically vary by state and range from 1 percent to 5 percent of a home’s insured value. These come into effect if certain triggers occur—a deductible triggering event can be, for instance, an official National Weather Service declaration that a storm is generating hurricane-strength winds (i.e., 74 miles per hour, or more) in your community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn coastal areas with high wind risk, some homeowners may select higher hurricane deductibles to lower their insurance premiums, but that means they pay more if their home is damaged. In some coastal communities, private homeowners insurance coverage may not be readily available. Instead, you may need to purchase insurance through a state-run insurance program, which can provide less coverage, and in some cases be more costly, than private insurance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Age of the Home</em></strong>\r\n\r\nA stately, older home can be quite beautiful, but ornate features such as plaster walls, ceiling molding and wooden floors may be costly to replace and raise the cost of insurance. Plumbing and electrical systems can become unsafe with age and lack of maintenance. So, older homes may cost more to insure. If you are considering buying an older home find out how much it will cost to update these features and factor it into the cost of ownership.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Condition of the Roof</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk about the condition of the roof. A new roof matters to insurers and keeps you and your family safer. Depending on the type of roof and whether or not you use fire and/or hail resistant materials, you may even qualify for a discount. Talk to your insurer about qualifying discounts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Is the Home Well-Built and Up to Code?</em></strong>\r\n\r\nFind out whether the house has been updated to comply with current building codes. Homes built by careful craftsmen and those built to meet modern engineering-based building codes are likely to better withstand natural disasters. Consider hiring a licensed home inspector who is knowledgeable about the latest building codes to inspect the property before you sign a mortgage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Risk of Flooding</em></strong>\r\n\r\nDamage from flooding is NOT covered by standard home insurance policies. If you are buying a home in an area at risk from flooding, you will need to purchase separate insurance. Insurance for flooding is available from the federal government’s <a href="http://www.floodsmart.gov/">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers. People often underestimate the risk of flooding. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the NFIP. More important is that 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses for flooding are for damage in areas not officially designated as special flood hazard areas. If you are not in a high-risk flood zone, NFIP coverage is available at a lower premium.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>History of Earthquakes </em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile earthquakes are most frequently associated with California, they have occurred in 39 states and, like flooding, are not covered under standard home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is available from private insurers as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, and in California from the <a href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/">California Earthquake Authority</a>, a privately funded, publicly managed organization.  The cost of earthquake insurance differs widely by location, insurer and the type of structure being covered. Generally, older buildings cost more to insure than new ones. Wood frame structures may benefit from lower rates than brick buildings because they tend to withstand quake stresses better. Regions are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 for likelihood of quakes, and this difference is reflected in insurance rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Swimming Pool or Other Special Feature</em></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the house has a swimming pool, hot tub or other special feature, you will likely need more liability insurance. You may also want to consider purchasing an excess or umbrella liability policy to provide added protection in the event someone gets injured on your property and decides to sue you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID ON THE HOME</h3>\r\n<strong><em>Check the Loss History Report</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAsk the current owner of the house for a copy of the insurance loss history report, such as a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.) report from ChoicePoint or an A-PLUS report from ISO, a leading source of information about property/casualty insurance. This is a record of insurance claims on the house that can provide answers to two questions that any savvy homebuyer should ask:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Have there been any past problems in the home?</li>\r\n	<li>If damage has occurred, was it properly repaired?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote that prior claims are not a barrier to getting insurance.

But your landlord’s policy won’t replace your personal possessions or pay for your living expenses while the building is being repaired.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe only way to protect yourself financially against disasters is to buy a renters insurance policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenters insurance, sometimes referred to as tenants insurance, includes three basic types of protection:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal possessions</li>\r\n	<li>Liability</li>\r\n	<li>Additional living expenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Personal Possessions</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStandard renters insurance protects your personal belongings against damage from fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism,\r\ntheft, explosion, windstorm, water and other disasters listed in the policy. Floods and earthquakes are not covered. Supplemental insurance is available to cover these disasters—see the Frequently Asked Questions section of the brochure for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo decide how much insurance to buy, you need to know the value of all your personal possessions including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, kitchen utensils and even towels and bedding. In other words, if your home were to burn, you should have enough insurance to replace all of your possessions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to figure out how much insurance coverage to buy is to create a home inventory (a detailed list of all of your personal possessions, with their estimated value). To help make this task easier, the Insurance Information Institute offers free Web-based software, which you can find at <a href="http://www2.iii.org/www.knowyourstuff.org" type="url">www.knowyourstuff.org</a>. An up-to-date home inventory will also make filing an insurance claim faster and easier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Liability</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nStandard renters insurance policies provide liability protection against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage your pets cause. So, for example, if your son, daughter or dog accidentally ruins your neighbor’s expensive rug, you’ll be covered. However, if your children or pets destroy your own rug, you will not be covered.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe liability portion of a renters policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and for court awards, up to the limit of the policy.  Liability limits generally start at about $100,000.  Some experts recommend that you buy at least $300,000 worth of protection. You can also buy an <em>Umbrella</em> or <em>Excess Liability</em> policy, which provides higher limits and broader coverage.  Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 a year for an extra $1 million of liability protection.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour policy also provides <em>No-fault Medical</em> coverage.  So, if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, you can submit their medical bills directly to your insurance company. You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage. It doesn’t, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Additional Living Expenses</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany people don’t know that <em>Additional Living Expenses</em> coverage, also known as ALE, is included in a renters insurance policy. If your home is destroyed by a disaster that your policy covers and you need to live elsewhere, renters insurance covers your additional living expenses.  Policies will generally reimburse you the difference between your additional living expenses and your normal living expenses. ALE covers hotel bills, temporary rentals, restaurant meals and other expenses you have incurred while your home is being rebuilt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>There are two types of renters insurance polices:</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> pays to replace your possessions minus an amount for depreciation (the reduction in the value of items due to age and use) up to the limit of your policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Replacement Cost</strong> pays the actual cost of replacing your possessions (with no deduction for depreciation), up to the limit of your policy. The price of Replacement Cost coverage is about 10 percent more than Actual Cash Value coverage but can be well worth the extra cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>How to Buy Renters Insurance</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRenters insurance is easy to get and there are many insurance companies to choose from. Insurers who offer homeowners insurance generally also sell renters insurance. In fact, a renters insurance policy and a homeowners insurance policy are almost identical. The main difference is that a renters policy doesn’t include coverage for the building, since the landlord owns that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Comparison Shop</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPrices vary from company to company, so it pays to shop around. Get at least three price quotes. You can call companies directly or get quotes from the Internet. Your state insurance department may also provide information about prices and can be reached by calling (713) 270-0073.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGet quotes from different types of insurance companies. Some insurers sell through their own agents. These agencies have the same name as the insurance company. Some sell through independent agents, who offer policies from several insurance companies. Others don’t use agents at all but sell directly to consumers over the phone or via the Internet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut don’t shop by price alone. Select a company that answers your questions and handles claims fairly and efficiently. Ask friends and relatives for their recommendations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLook for an agent or company representative who takes the time to answer your questions.  Remember, you’ll be dealing with this person if you have an accident or other emergency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Ask Your Insurer How You Can Save Money</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese are some ways to save money on premiums: Consider taking a higher deductible (the amount of money you have to pay toward a loss before your insurance company starts to pay a claim). The higher your deductible, the more money you save on your premium. Consider a deductible of at least $500. If you can afford to raise it to $1,000, you may get as much as 25 percent off your premium.  Remember, though, that you’ll pay the deductible each time you file a claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInsurance companies often offer discounts on renters insurance if you have another policy with them for your car or business. You can also get discounts if your apartment has a security system, smoke detectors or deadbolt locks. More discounts might be available depending on your age or whether or not you smoke.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Filing a Renters Insurance Claim</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>REPORT ANY CRIME TO THE POLICE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police. Get a police report and the names of all law enforcement officers with whom you speak.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>CALL (713) 270-0073 TO GET ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS:</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How long to I have to file a claim? (There are time limits on claims filing.)</li>\r\n	<li>Do I have the coverage I need?</li>\r\n	<li>Does my claim exceed my deductible?</li>\r\n	<li>How long will it take to process the claim?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>PREPARE A LIST OF LOST OR DAMAGED ARTICLES</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to substantiate your loss. Don’t throw out damaged items until a claims adjuster has visited\r\nyour home. You should also consider photographing or videotaping the damage. Prepare a list of damaged or stolen items for your adjuster along with copies of receipts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>IF YOU NEED TO RELOCATE, KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your home is severely damaged and you need to find other accommodations while repairs are being\r\nmade, keep records of all expenses.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>GET CLAIM FORMS</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve notified your insurer of your claim, the company is required to send the necessary claim forms to you by the end of a set time period. (The time period varies from state to state.) Return the properly filled out forms as soon as possible to speed up your claim.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>If you feel your insurer hasn’t given you satisfactory service</strong>, you should talk to the agent or company representative who sold you your policy or your insurer’s claims manager. If you’re still unhappy, contact your state insurance department or local consumer protection office to discuss what you can do.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nState insurance department telephone numbers and Web site addresses can be found <a href="http://www2.iii.org/stateorganizations/">here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my bicycle covered by renters insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Your bicycle and other recreational or sports equipment are covered. There are also special policies you can buy for very expensive sports equipment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my car covered?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Vehicles aren’t covered by renters insurance.  You need to get a separate auto insurance policy to drive legally and protect your car, van or motorcycle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. As a student, am I covered by my parents’ insurance?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. If you’re a college student living in a dorm and are still part of your parents’ household, their homeowners or renters insurance provides coverage. If you live off campus, you’ll probably need your own renters policy. Policies can vary, so speak to your insurer about this.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Can I purchase a renters policy with my roommate or domestic partner?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Regulations differ from state to state, and policies might also differ from company to company. Find out\r\nwhat regulations apply where you live. Some insurance companies allow unmarried couples who have been living together to buy joint coverage. But a domestic partner is usually not automatically insured, like a husband or wife, under the partner’s policy. He or she must be specifically named.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. What happens if something I have rented or borrowed is stolen?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Items that are “in your possession” are covered under a standard renters policy, whether they are things that you’ve bought, received as gifts or borrowed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Is my property covered away from home?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Yes, most renters polices include what is called Off-premises coverage.  This means that belongings that are outside of your home are also covered against the same disasters listed in your policy. For example, property stolen from your car would be covered. However, there are generally dollar limits on the amount you can be reimbursed. For example, if you have $25,000 worth of personal possessions insurance, you may be covered for up to $2,500, or 10 percent of the total.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Q. Are my valuables covered by my renters insurance policy?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. In general you are covered for up to $1,500 for jewelry or other expensive items that are destroyed or lost to fire, windstorms, theft or other perils that are listed in your policy.  If your valuables are worth more than that, you should consider purchasing a “floater,” also called an “endorsement,” to increase the amount of coverage.\r\n<strong>\r\nQ. How can I protect my house or apartment against a flood or earthquake?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. Renters insurance does not cover floods or earthquakes. Flood coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program (888) 379-9531, www.floodsmart.gov ) and from a few private insurers. You can get this coverage, however, from the same agent or company representative who sold you the renters insurance policy. Earthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an “endorsement” to your renters policy.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Renters', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '165-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:27:27', '2014-03-29 10:27:27', '', 165, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/165-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third party insurance claims, i.e., payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. In general, damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. When a claim is made, the insurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured.

It also compensates them for lost wages and provides death benefits for their dependents if they are killed in work-related accidents, including terrorist attacks. The workers compensation system is the “exclusive remedy” for on-the-job injuries suffered by employees. As part of the social contract embedded in each state’s law, the employee gives up the right to sue the employer for injuries caused by the employer’s negligence and in return receives workers compensation benefits regardless of who or what caused the accident, as long as it happened in the workplace as a result of and in the course of workplace activities.\r\n\r\nWorkers compensation systems vary from state to state. State statutes and court decisions control many aspects, including the handling of claims, the evaluation of impairment and settlement of disputes, the amount of benefits injured workers receive and the strategies used to control costs. From 2008 to 2009 maximum income benefits for total disability increased an average 3.67 percent. The average maximum weekly benefit in 2009 was $763.16, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2009 Analysis of Workers Compensation Laws.\r\n\r\nWorkers compensation costs are one of the many factors that influence businesses to expand or relocate in a state, generating jobs. When premiums rise sharply, legislators often call for reforms. The last round of widespread reform legislation started in the late 1980s. In general, the reforms enabled employers and insurers to better control medical care costs through coordination and oversight of the treatment plan and return-to-work process and to improve workplace safety. Some states are now approaching a crisis once again as new problems arise.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>National:</strong> According to A.M. Best, workers compensation premiums for 2009 dropped 14.5 percent to $12.3 billion, the lowest level in 10 years, while the combined ratio, the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses, rose 8.8 percentage points to 120 percent. The deterioration in profitability was driven by a continuous decrease in premiums as poor economic conditions reduced the number of people in work force and intense competition for business reduced prices for coverage.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI) released in September 2010 shows that workers compensation payments for medical care and cash benefits that help cover lost wages increased 4.4 percent in 2008, the latest available data, to $57.6 billion. For the first time, but reflecting a long-term growth trend in medical spending for the past 30 years, medical benefits totaled more than half of all benefits paid, driven by an 8.8 percent increase in payments for medical care. The increase in wage replacement payments was minimal (0.3 percent). Overall, employers’ costs declined by 6.7 percent to $78.9 billion. Per $100 of payroll, the basis for computing workers compensation, employer costs in 2008 were $1.33, a 0.11 percent decrease from the previous year. Cash benefits to workers per $100 of payroll dropped 0.01 percent to $0.48. This is the lowest level since 1980, according to NASI.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>State activities:</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Denial of Coverage to Illegal Immigrants: </strong>Bills that would deny workers compensation benefits to illegal aliens who are injured in the workplace appear to have stalled. Legislation was introduced in Georgia, Montana, New Hampshire and South Carolina earlier in the year but has not been enacted in any state.</li>\r\n	<li>Although federal law prohibits knowingly hiring illegal immigrants, once hired, most states do provide workers compensation benefits regardless of immigration status and courts have generally held that such workers are entitled to benefits. In general, insurers are opposed to denying benefits to illegal aliens. First, it runs counter to public policy. Workers compensation laws serve a humanitarian purpose. In addition, denial could encourage unscrupulous employers to seek out illegal aliens, knowing that they could avoid the cost of workers compensation coverage and thus gain a marketplace advantage over their law-abiding competitors. Second, the workers compensation’s exclusive remedy provision protects employers from lawsuits charging them with negligence in the workplace. Without this protection, when workers are injured, whether or not they are illegal aliens, employers are exposed to civil litigation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>North Carolina:</strong> A bill, H.B. 709, is making its way through the legislature. Among other things, it caps payments to a totally disabled worker. The current law, which has no cap so benefits can continue for a lifetime, raises overall costs to the point where the state is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new business relative to states that have different and less costly systems, the bill’s sponsors say. Another provision extends the maximum time death benefits can be paid to dependents and wage benefits can be paid to partially disabled workers.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Illinois:</strong> Shortly before the legislature was to adjourn on May 31, the House passed H.B. 1698 on a second try. The bill aims to curb escalating costs and create a more attractive and competitive business environment by cutting medical fees to doctors and hospitals by 30 percent, for a potential reduction in costs of up to $700 million, lowering the number of weeks workers with carpal tunnel syndrome receive benefits to 28.5 from the current 40, and using AMA guidelines to determine the degree of impairment.</li>\r\n	<li>Costs in Illinois are the third highest in the nation, according to a biannual premium ranking from the Oregon Department of Commerce and Business Services. Only Montana and Alaska have higher costs. The centerpiece of the legislation was cutting payments to doctors and hospitals but initially some lawmakers objected to such steep cuts. Critics say the most serious weakness in the state’s workers compensation system is “causation,” meaning the extent to which injuries are work-related, which the measure did not address. Earlier in the year, the Governor suggested a package of reforms, among them strengthening the causation standard so that only injuries that are held to be more than 50 percent employment-related would be compensable.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Kansas:</strong> In April 2011 Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed into law a bill that makes substantial changes to the workers compensation system, which the Governor characterized as a good compromise between the needs of business and labor. The legislation makes injuries caused by repetitive trauma and occupational disease compensable; strengthens the causation standard so that the work incident is the prevailing factor for an injury to be compensable; clarifies rules governing payments to employers when an employee with pre-existing conditions not related to the current employer’s workplace is injured; and raises benefit caps for workers with various degrees of disability.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Montana:</strong> Also in April Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed a much-brokered major workers compensation reform bill (HB 334) which, the NCCI says, could lower costs by about $100 million. Montana’s system is currently the most expensive, according to the Oregon Department of Commerce and Business Services. The measure terminates medical benefits five years after the date of injury or occupational disease diagnosis, but allows cases related to older injuries to be reviewed every two years and be reopened if justified by medical evidence; freezes the medical fee schedule for two years until mid 2013; and requires disability payments for partial disability to be based on wage loss. To improve return to work rates, “stay at work/return to work” services will be provided.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Oklahoma is one of a handful of states where the courts administer the workers compensation system. Legislation modifying the court system was passed in 2010 and continued in 2011 but critics are aiming to shift the court-based system to an administrative one in the future. In 2011, in a major push to reduce workers compensation costs, legislation developed by a special study group set up by Gov. Mary Fallin was approved by the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 44-0 in March.  Gov. Fallin has called the system’s high costs an obstacle to job creation.</li>\r\n	<li>The bill, SB 878, passed the legislature in May after months of negotiation. The measure would radically change the state’s workers compensation statute, the first major overhaul in more than three decades. Among other things, it tightens the definition of a compensable injury; requires a new medical fees to be developed that would result in an overall reduction in medical care costs of 5 percent; significantly reduces the maximum period during which an injured worker can receive temporary total disability benefits; and requires the use of nationally recognized treatment guidelines to control the type of treatment injured workers receive, standards that are used in Texas and Kansas. In addition, the measure would facilitate a worker’s early return to the workplace through vocational rehabilitation programs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Texas:</strong> Major reforms were enacted in 2005 that transferred responsibility for workers compensation from a commission to the Texas Insurance Department, improved access to healthcare and advice for injured workers, promoted return-to-work programs, created medical treatment guidelines and raised injured workers’ benefits.</li>\r\n	<li>In January 2011 the department published its biennial report on system improvements. Highlights of the report indicate that since 2005, the nonfatal occupational injury/illness rate in the state has decreased 19 percent, from 3.6 to 2.9 injuries per 100 full-time employees (the rate of injury also dropped nationally, see below). The percentage of employers that participate in the program (i.e., became subscribers, see Background section) rose from 62 percent in 2004 to 68 percent in 2010, due mainly to lower premiums, down 40 percent since 2003, and the increased availability of workers compensation healthcare networks. And the percentage of injured employees receiving temporary income benefits who initially returned to work within six months of their injury rose from 74 percent in 2004 to 80 percent in 2009. Of those, 71 percent remained employed for three consecutive quarters compared with 66 percent in 2004.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>California:</strong> Insurance commissioner Dave Jones opposed the suggested 29.6 rate increase requested by the Workers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau.  The bureau’s recommendations are advisory only. The bureau noted that even with the proposed increase, rates would still be 53 percent lower than those in effect on July 1, 2003, the year reforms designed to stabilize the cost of the system were adopted.</li>\r\n	<li>Despite the reduction in cost, many believe that the system is still too litigious. A study by the California Workers Compensation Institute found that between 2000 and 2008 attorneys were involved in nearly 44 percent of all lost time claims (those in which the injury caused time off work) and in more than 86 percent of claims involving permanent disability. The legislative and administrative intent of the 2003/2004 reforms was to eliminate the perceived unpredictability of medical and disability assessments. However, the fine print of the legislation and the implementation and adjudication of the rules and regulations, including inconsistencies in Workers Compensation Appeals Board decisions, have compromised the potential impact of the reforms and led to new types of disputes. These include disagreements as to the conditions that can be defined as eligible for permanent disability benefits and the apportionment of such disability between work-related and non-work-related medical conditions.</li>\r\n	<li>A recent RAND Institute for Civil Justice study commissioned by the California Commission on Health and Safety and Workers Compensation and conducted with Navigant Consulting found that the volatility in the state’s workers compensation market after rates were partially deregulated in 1995 was due largely to inaccurate cost projections. To improve the accuracy of cost projections, researchers recommend that future reform legislation be written in more explicit language and that more comprehensive data be made available on workers compensation claims. In addition, to improve the reliability of actuarial opinions, the California Department of Insurance should consider hiring its own actuaries and then charging insurers for their services to reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest in the preparation of reports and that, to catch insurers likely to fail earlier, the Department should create an early warning system that would trigger mandatory financial examinations. The researchers also suggest that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Risk-Based Capital system, which sets targets for capital (policyholders’ surplus) according to the riskiness of an insurer’s business, is not stringent enough.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>State Funds, Competitive Funds:</strong> Following the successful change over in West Virginia from a state-controlled workers compensation system to a private competitive market, several states, including Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma, all of which have workers compensation entities with some degree of state oversight that compete with the private market, have been looking into some form of privatization. Some impetus for the sale of these entities is the poor local economy and the resulting budget deficits. (Other states are raiding special workers compensation funds where money has been set aside for specific purposes such as paying the claims of insolvent insurers.)</li>\r\n	<li>In Arizona, the legislature has agreed to privatize the State Compensation Fund, requiring the transaction to be completed by 2013. The fund had a market share of 31.5 percent in 2009, according to the state’s department of insurance.</li>\r\n	<li>In Oklahoma CompSource, which insures about 35 percent of the market, has a 5 percent advantage over private insurers because it does not pay premium taxes. A legislative task force studying the options voted 5 to 4 in favor of creating a mutual company, but the idea was dropped when opponents said that it would result in higher premiums for small businesses.  Most of the businesses in the state are small, with 98 percent having fewer than 100 workers and 75 percent having fewer than 10, according to the State Chamber of Oklahoma.</li>\r\n	<li>In Colorado Pinnacol Assurance, a quasi-mutual company with almost 60 percent of the market, is also exempt from premiums taxes. A legislative committee charged with reviewing the feasibility of Pinnacol’s continued operation as a division of state government or of selling it to a third party recommended a number of measures, including changing it to a mutual company that would still serve as a market of last resort. But the proposal failed to gain enough support.</li>\r\n	<li>In Washington State, which has a monopolistic state fund, a ballot initiative that would have led to opening the market to private competition was defeated in the November 2010 elections. Voters rejected the initiative, I-1082, by a wide margin. The initiative was spearheaded by the Building Industry Association of Washington and endorsed by the National Federal of Independent Business. It would have created a task force on private competition to draw up legislation and make recommendations.</li>\r\n	<li>In Ohio, which also has a monopolistic state fund, there has also been interest in allowing some form of competition from private insurers. In November 2009 the Senate voted to create a task force to evaluate the current system, compare it with competitive systems in other states and review the options. At a hearing held in August 2010, the president of the Insurance Information Institute, Robert Hartwig, suggested that the state’s monopolistic system is out of keeping with economic reality. There is no other type of liability insurance in the United States where the state is the sole provider of coverage although states have had ample opportunity to create such a system. Ohio voters rejected a ballot initiative on privatization in 1981. Ohio has the largest monopolistic state fund in the nation. It would require a constitutional amendment to totally privatize Ohio’s system.</li>\r\n	<li>In July 1, 2008 West Virginia opened up its workers compensation business to any insurer that meets state requirements. Before, coverage was only available from the state-run mutual company. In readiness for the change over, 147 insurers filed rates; 23 were new to the state, according to the insurance department. The state was one of five with a so-called monopolist state fund, from which all employers, except those that are self-insured, must purchase their workers compensation coverage. The privatization process was phased in. A private mutual insurance company was created in June 2005. Nevada went through a similar change several years ago, enacting legislation to begin the workers compensation privatization process in 1999. It now has a mutual insurance company.</li>\r\n	<li>The move to privatize comes at a time when state funds are growing. According to a new Conning Research &amp; Consulting study, Workers Compensation State Funds: Evolution of a Competitive Force, state-backed workers compensation funds operate in 25 states and account for one-quarter ($11.3 billion in premiums) of the workers compensation market. While they generally have higher losses than private insurers (they are often the market of last resort, insuring high risk businesses that cannot find coverage in the private marketplace) these are offset by higher investment income and operating results comparable to private insurers, the study found. State funds also work closely with other government agencies, such as state occupational and health and safety associations, to reduce injuries.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Financial Results:</strong> In May 2011 the NCCI released its annual "State of the Line" workers compensation market analysis, showing that in the 2010 calendar year the workers compensation system produced a large underwriting loss, with a combined ratio of 115, compared with 110 for 2009, although as in 2009 three percentage points were due to a single insurer adding to its reserves. In 2010 the figure was $800 million, the year before $1 billion. Even at 112, this is a considerable deterioration from 2009. State funds fared even worse, reporting a combined ratio of 120 compared with several years of 111-115.</li>\r\n	<li>Premiums in 2010 were lower than in 2009, but the drop was less precipitous than in prior years, decreasing just 1.3 percent from 12 months earlier.</li>\r\n	<li>An analysis by the Insurance Information Institute shows that although unemployment and the resulting loss of payroll, the basis for workers compensation premiums, contributed to the sharp drop in premium over the past several years, aggressive pricing along with large deductible programs, and the use of captives and self insurance are responsible for a significant portion of this decline, which started as far back as 2006. Another depressing factor is the drop in interest rates. Low rates reduce the amount of investment income available to offset underwriting losses. According to A.M.Best, a 1 percent drop in yield on an insurer’s investment portfolio requires a 5.7 improvement in the workers compensation combined ratio.</li>\r\n	<li>The residual market share, as measured by premiums, fell again in 2010 but there are signs that it could be creeping up: premiums for the residual market were slightly higher in the first quarter 2011 than in the same quarter 2010. Residual market premiums totaled $400 million, down from $700 million in 2008, representing a 5 percent market share, about the same as in 2009. Among businesses insured in the residual market, large employers are most likely to be leaving.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Obesity and Workplace Injury Costs:</strong> Initial findings from an NCCI study on the cost of claims filed by workers who are obese found that their claim costs were significantly higher than those filed by nonobese workers. The findings are similar to a 2007 study of employees at Duke University. There, workers who were morbidly obese (those with body mass index (BMI) of 40 and above) filed 45 percent more claims, missed eight times the number of workdays and experienced medical costs that were more than five times higher than those of nonobese workers. Likewise, workers who were overweight (those with a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9) filed 9 percent more claims, with costs that were 1.5 times as high as people with so-called normal weights (a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9) and missed up to 3.5 times as many workdays. The NCCI study results, which will help underwriters more accurately assess how obesity is pushing up workers compensation claim costs, was released in December 2010.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Workplace Deaths and Injuries:</strong> Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data show that 4,340 workers were killed on the job in 2009, compared with 5,071 workplace fatalities in 2008 and 5,657 in 2007, with the greatest decrease in transportation-related deaths. The death rate for 2009 per 100,000 workers was 3.3 compared with 3.7 in 2008, a significant drop that many experts attribute to the poor economy. Fewer people were working last year in jobs where many of the fatalities typically occur such as construction.</li>\r\n	<li>Workplace injury rates are now at their lowest level since the BLS began tracking information in the 1970s, according to the agency. BLS data show rates for private workplace injuries and illnesses dropped 7 percent from 2007 to 2008, the latest available data. In 2008 the rate decreased to 113 per 10,000 full-time workers and the number of cases dropped by 80,730. Some 1.1 million cases requiring days off work or restricted duties were reported in private industry workplaces, down from 1.2 million in 2007.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the NCCI on the number of claims (frequency), published in the summer of 2009, found that claims frequency had dropped 4.0 percent in 2008, compared with 2.6 percent in 2007. The number of claims overall has been falling since the 1990s but the size of the decrease has been fluctuating from year to year. In 2005 and 2003 the drop was close to 7 percent but in 1999 it was 2.3 percent and there were even slight increases in 1994 and 1997. Almost every employment category the NCCI examined has experienced declines.</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of claims (severity) has continued to grow, however, particularly for medical care, with an estimated jump of 6.0 percent for workers compensation medical care costs, compared with an estimated 3.7 percent for the medical care consumer price index. As part of the review, the NCCI looked at changes in permanent total claims, the costliest 1 percent of lost-time claims, which have risen significantly over the past few years, driven primarily by injuries to people under 50.</li>\r\n	<li>A study by the Texas Department of Insurance Research and Evaluation of workers injured between 2004 and 2007 showed that workers are returning to work faster. For 2007 some 76 percent of workers returned to work within six months of the injury, compared with 72 percent in 2003. After 18 months, 91 percent had returned in 2007, compared with 85 percent in 2003.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>', 'Workers Compensation', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '171-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 10:36:54', '2014-03-29 10:36:54', '', 171, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/171-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The coverage focuses on alleged failure to perform on the part of, financial loss caused by, and error or omission in the service or product sold by the policyholder. These are potential causes for legal action that would not be covered by a more general liability insurance policy which addresses more direct forms of harm. Professional liability coverage sometimes also provides for the defence costs, including when legal action turns out to be groundless. Coverage does not include <a title="Criminal prosecution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_prosecution">criminal prosecution</a>, nor a wide range of potential liabilities under <a title="Civil law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law">civil law</a> that are not enumerated in the policy, but which may be subject to other forms of insurance. Professional liability insurance is required by law in some areas for certain kinds of professional practice (especially medical and legal), and is also sometimes required under contract by other businesses that are the beneficiaries of the advice or service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nProfessional liability insurance may take on different forms and names depending on the profession. For example, in reference to <a title="Medical profession" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_profession">medical professions</a> it is called <strong>malpractice insurance</strong>, while <strong>errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance</strong> is used by <a title="Consultant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant">consultants</a>, <a title="Broker" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker">brokers</a> and <a title="Lawyer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer">lawyers</a>.

Yet a recent nationwide study found that the number of households covered by individual life insurance has decreased, according to the <a href="http://www.iii.org/">Insurance Information Institute</a> (I.I.I.).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“You need life insurance coverage if you are the primary wage earner in a household, or if someone relies on you financially,” said Michael Barry, the I.I.I.’s vice president, Media Relations. “And the premium payments are reasonable when you consider the level of protection a policyholder’s beneficiaries receive.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href="http://www.limra.com/">LIMRA</a>, its upcoming 2010 <em>Trends in Life Insurance Ownership</em> study indicates that 11 million U.S. households with children under the age of 18 have no individual life insurance policyholder in the family. LIMRA says in the same report that individual life insurance coverage in the U.S. has hit a 50-year low.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLIMRA does note that one in four U.S. households in 2010 had a wage earner who was covered under a group life insurance policy, often secured through their employer. The economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, however, has had an impact in this area, too, because these wage earners often lose their only life insurance coverage if they become unemployed or have their work hours reduced.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an individual or group life insurance policy, a deceased wage earner’s spouse and school-age beneficiaries may need to rely largely on Social Security survivor benefits as their main source of income.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThose in the market for life insurance need to know there are two major types of policies: Term and Permanent.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li><strong>Term insurance</strong> is a form of life insurance that pays out only if the death occurs during the “term” of the policy, which is usually anywhere from one to 30 years. The premium rates for term policies are comparatively less expensive than they used to be, as Americans as a whole live longer and healthier lives.\r\n\r\nIf you are buying a short-term life insurance policy (under 10 years), look for renewal guarantees. A renewal guarantee gives you the right to start a new term after the current one ends. You will pay a higher premium based on your current age, but will not be required to undergo a new health exam nor submit any other “evidence of insurability.” Without the renewal guarantee, you would have to start from scratch when applying for a policy and, if your health has deteriorated in the interim, you might end up paying significantly higher premiums or not getting coverage at all.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li><strong>Permanent</strong> <strong>life insurance</strong> encompasses several subcategories, including traditional whole life, universal life, variable life and variable universal life.

You should make sure that the company that issues your policy will be around to service it and eventually to pay the death claim. There are several ratings agencies that assess insurance companies on their ability to remain financially sound over the long term. A rating represents an independent assessment of the insurer''s ability to pay its claims on time and meet all its other financial obligations; reviewing these ratings can help you find a financially strong company.

Policies available through the workplace often have the advantage of group rates and limited medical underwriting. Employers may subsidize their group insurance costs as well. It is worth exploring what is available to you through the workplace and comparing it to coverage available to you as an individual. In comparing group to individual life insurance, remember that if you have over $50,000 of group life insurance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines how much it costs to provide the amount over $50,000 and imputes taxable income for that cost.

Dental insurance companies have similar fee schedules which are generally based on <a title="Usual, customary and reasonable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usual,_customary_and_reasonable">Usual and Customary dental services</a>, an average of fees in your area. When a dentist signs a contract with a dental insurance company that provider agrees to match the insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced cost for services, this is considered an In-Network Provider or Participating Provider network (PPO). Depending on your specific plan, if you seek an Out-of-Network or Non-Participating Provider, any difference of fees will become the financial responsibility of the patient unless otherwise specified in your dental policy. Some dental insurance plans may have <a title="Waiting period" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_period">waiting period</a> restrictions. This is a period of time before certain benefits will be covered, and is often set in place when you are a new enrollee or seek out an independent plan outside of an employer or group.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDental insurance plans may have an annual maximum benefit limit and after that maximum benefit additional treatments become the patient''s responsibility. Each year that annual maximum is reissued. The reissued date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year, or date of enrollment based on your specific plan. <a title="Orthodontics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics">Orthodontics</a> usually has a separate limit. Some plans may have an annual <a title="Deductible" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible">deductible</a> depending on the treatment rendered. After the deductible is met, the remaining fee is then paid at its specified percentage or fee schedule.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDental insurance companies set services or procedures into categories and refer to them with American Dental Association (ADA) codes. As an example, Preventative and Diagnostic procedures often include exams, <a title="Dental radiography" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_radiography">x-rays</a>, and <a title="Dental cleaning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_cleaning">basic cleanings</a> or <a title="Preventive medicine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine#Prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a>. Basic procedures often include <a title="Dental restoration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration">fillings</a>, <a title="Periodontology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology">periodontics</a>, <a title="Endodontics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics">endodontics</a>, and <a title="Oral surgery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_surgery">oral surgery</a>. Major procedures often are <a title="Crown (dentistry)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_%28dentistry%29">crowns</a>, <a title="Dentures" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures">dentures</a>, and <a title="Dental implant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant">implants</a>. Procedures such as periodontics, endodontics, and oral surgery may fall into the Major category depending on your specific plan with specific fee schedules and co-payments. Many dental insurance plans offer free semi-annual preventative treatment. Fillings, crowns, implants and dentures may have various limitations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe enrollment process varies but often members are assigned an identification or policy number. When dental treatment is rendered a claim for services is filed with the dental insurance company. Eligibility of Benefits, or EOB, statements are most often then sent with payment to both the provider of service and the plan policy holder.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUpon enrollment, be informed through the enrollee benefit packet regarding coverage and contact a dental provider and/or dental insurance company with additional questions about specific dental benefits.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Dental', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '197-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:10:51', '2014-03-29 11:10:51', '', 197, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/197-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

In other words, people belong to the group not because they possess some high-risk factor which makes them more apt to purchase insurance (thus increasing adverse selection); instead they are in the group for reasons unrelated to insurance, such as all working for a particular employer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA feature which is sometimes common in group insurance is that the premium cost on an individual basis may not be risk-based. Instead it is the same amount for all the insured persons in the group. So, for example, in the United States, often all employees of an employer receiving health insurance coverage pay the same premium amount for the same coverage regardless of their age or other factors. In contrast, under private individual health insurance coverage in the U.S., different insured persons will pay different premium amounts for the same coverage based on their age, location, pre-existing conditions, etc.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature is that under group coverage, a member of the group is generally eligible to purchase or renew coverage while he or she is a member of the group subject to certain conditions. Again, using U.S. health coverage as an example, under group insurance a person will normally remain covered as long as he or she continues to work for a certain employer and pays the required insurance premiums, whereas under individual coverage, the insurance company often has the right to non-renew a person''s individual health insurance policy when the policy is up for renewal, which it may do if the person''s risk profile changes (though some states limit the insurance company''s ability to non-renew after the person has been under individual coverage with a given company for a certain number of years).\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Group Insurance', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '203-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:15:21', '2014-03-29 11:15:21', '', 203, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/203-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Coverage is usually about $1,000 or 10 percent of the home''s property value and generally includes the boat, motor and trailer combined. Liability coverage is typically not included–but it can be added as an endorsement to a homeowners policy. Check with your insurance representative to find out if your boat is covered and what the limits are.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLarger and faster boats such as yachts, and personal watercraft such as jet skis and wave runners require a separate boat insurance policy. The size, type and value of the craft and the water in which you use it factor into how much you will pay for insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor physical loss or damage, coverage includes the hull, machinery, fittings, furnishings and permanently attached equipment as part of either an actual cash value policy or on an agreed amount value basis. These policies also provide broader liability protection than a homeowners policy. But there are distinct differences between the two types of policies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> policies pay for replacement costs less depreciation at the time of the loss. In the event of a total loss, used boat pricing guides and other resources are used to determine the vessel’s approximate market value. Partial losses are settled by taking the total cost of the repair less a percentage for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Agreed Amount Value</strong> basis policies mean that you and your insurer have agreed on the value of your vessel and in the event of a total loss you will be paid that amount. Agreed Amount Value policies also replace old items for new in the event of a partial loss, without any deduction for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>Physical damage exclusions might include normal wear and tear, damage from insects, mold, animals (such as sharks), zebra mussels, defective machinery or machinery damage.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\nBoat insurance also covers:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Bodily injury—for injuries caused to another person</li>\r\n	<li>Property damage—for damage caused to someone else’s property</li>\r\n	<li>Guest passenger liability—for any legal expenses incurred by someone using the boat with the owner’s permission</li>\r\n	<li>Medical payments—for injuries to the boat owner and other passengers</li>\r\n	<li>Theft</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMost companies offer liability limits that start at $15,000 and can be increased to $300,000.

Coverage is usually about $1,000 or 10 percent of the home''s property value and generally includes the boat, motor and trailer combined. Liability coverage is typically not included–but it can be added as an endorsement to a homeowners policy. Check with your insurance representative to find out if your boat is covered and what the limits are.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLarger and faster boats such as yachts, and personal watercraft such as jet skis and wave runners require a separate boat insurance policy. The size, type and value of the craft and the water in which you use it factor into how much you will pay for insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor physical loss or damage, coverage includes the hull, machinery, fittings, furnishings and permanently attached equipment as part of either an actual cash value policy or on an agreed amount value basis. These policies also provide broader liability protection than a homeowners policy. But there are distinct differences between the two types of policies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Actual Cash Value</strong> policies pay for replacement costs less depreciation at the time of the loss. In the event of a total loss, used boat pricing guides and other resources are used to determine the vessel’s approximate market value. Partial losses are settled by taking the total cost of the repair less a percentage for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Agreed Amount Value</strong> basis policies mean that you and your insurer have agreed on the value of your vessel and in the event of a total loss you will be paid that amount. Agreed Amount Value policies also replace old items for new in the event of a partial loss, without any deduction for depreciation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>Physical damage exclusions might include normal wear and tear, damage from insects, mold, animals (such as sharks), zebra mussels, defective machinery or machinery damage.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\nBoat insurance also covers:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Bodily injury—for injuries caused to another person</li>\r\n	<li>Property damage—for damage caused to someone else’s property</li>\r\n	<li>Guest passenger liability—for any legal expenses incurred by someone using the boat with the owner’s permission</li>\r\n	<li>Medical payments—for injuries to the boat owner and other passengers</li>\r\n	<li>Theft</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMost companies offer liability limits that start at $15,000 and can be increased to $300,000. Typical policies include deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1000 for medical payments. Higher limits may be available. Additional coverage can be purchased for trailers and other accessories. Boat owners may also consider purchasing an umbrella liability policy which will provide additional protection for their boat, home and car.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBoaters should also inquire about special equipment kept on the boat, such as fishing gear, to make sure it is covered and verify that towing coverage is included in the policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBoat owners should also inquire about discounts for the following:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul type="square">\r\n	<li>Diesel powered craft, which are less hazardous than gasoline powered boats as they are less likely to explode</li>\r\n	<li>Coast Guard approved fire extinguishers</li>\r\n	<li>Ship-to-shore radios</li>\r\n	<li>Two years of claims-free experience</li>\r\n	<li>Multi-policies with the same insurer, such as a car, home or umbrella policy</li>\r\n	<li>Safety education courses, such as those offered by the <a href="http://www.cgaux.org/" type="Url">Coast Guard Auxiliary</a>, <a href="http://www.usps.org/" type="Url">U.S. Power Squadrons</a>, or the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/" type="Url">American Red Cross</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Boat Safety</strong></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of recreational boating accidents per year.

Keep them readily accessible and in condition for immediate use.</li>\r\n	<li>Equip the vessel with required navigation lights and with a whistle, horn or bell.</li>\r\n	<li>Consider additional safety devices, such as a paddle or oars, a first-aid kit, a supply of fresh water, a tool kit and spare parts, a flashlight, flares and a radio.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Care and protection of crew and guests</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<ol start="1" type="1">\r\n	<li>Make sure that every person on board the boat wears a life-jacket.</li>\r\n	<li>Know and obey marine traffic laws, the "Rules-of-the-Road."

You want it to fit your needs and lifestyle, but at the same time be within your budget. Although most states require you to carry a minimum amount of liability coverage, other types of coverage are usually optional. Always ask your insurance agent or company representative which laws apply in your state.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn order to find out what coverage is best for you, it is important to understand all the options available.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>LIABILITY COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLiability insurance covers bodily injury and property damage that you may cause to other people involved in an accident. It doesn''t cover you or your motorcycle. Find out if your coverage includes Guest Passenger Liability, which provides protection in the event that a passenger is injured on the motorcycle. Whether or not this is included depends on the laws of your state and the company issuing the policy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>COLLISION COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCollision insurance covers damage to your motorcycle if you are involved in an accident. Your insurance company pays for damages, minus your deductible, caused when you collide with another vehicle or object. Collision insurance usually covers the book value of the motorcycle before the loss occurred.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nComprehensive coverage pays for damages caused by an event other than a collision, such as fire, theft or vandalism. However, just like collision coverage, your insurance company will pay for damages, minus your deductible, and will cover only the book value of the motorcycle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep in mind most comprehensive and collision coverages will only cover the factory standard parts on your motorcycle. If you decide to add on any optional accessories such as chrome parts, a custom paint job, trailers or sidecars, you should look into obtaining additional or optional equipment coverage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUninsured/underinsured Motorist Coverage covers damages to you and your property caused by another driver who either doesn''t have insurance (uninsured) or doesn''t have adequate insurance (underinsured) to cover your damages.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis coverage typically pays for medical treatment, lost wages and other damages. If your uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage includes property damage, then your motorcycle would also be covered under the same circumstances. Check with your insurance professional to see if property damage is included or needs to be purchased separately.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>TIPS FOR THE COST-CONSCIOUS RIDER</h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany factors can play a role in determining what your insurance costs will be such as your age, your driving record, where you live and the type of motorcycle you own, or being a graduate of a rider-training course.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Many companies offer discounts from 10 to 15 percent on motorcycle insurance for graduates of training courses, such as the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) rider course. Riders under the age of 25, usually considered a higher risk, may see some savings by taking this course. It’s also a good idea for cyclists who have already had accidents.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining a good driving record with no violations will also help reduce your premiums.</li>\r\n	<li>In many northern states, riders may save money by buying a "lay-up" policy. With a lay-up policy, all coverage except comprehensive is suspended during winter months.</li>\r\n	<li>Find out what discounts your insurance representative offers. Multibike discounts for those insuring more than one bike, organization discounts, if you’re a member of a motorcycle association, and mature rider discounts for experienced riders, are just a few possibilities. Discounts can range anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent, depending on the company and your state. Availability and qualifications for discounts vary from company to company and state to state.</li>\r\n	<li>Keep in mind that the type, style (such as a sports bike vs. a cruiser) and age of the motorcycle, as well as the number of miles you drive a year and where you store your bike may also affect how much you pay for your premium.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'Motorcycle', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '189-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-29 11:22:52', '2014-03-29 11:22:52', '', 189, 'http://jimenez.net16.net/189-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
